 way of the transcendence of will to power. There are two clues: first, through fiction or non-text, that is through images of human or animal, physical or spiritual, and inauthentic; second, through the will to the truth coming to consciousness not as a principle but as a problem. Asceticism can be naturalised, that is a return to the original Greek concept of askesis (training), a discipline of improving strength and health.

‘Asia’ or the ‘East’ usually delivers to the following ideas that Russia as a significant rival to European power, or as a critical origin for nihilism and anarchism;  culture, social systems or philosophical systems in India or China, founded on Hinduism or Buddhism; relatedly, China about its capacity for an industrious class without resentment; the area to the east of Greek civilisation, particularly as the ‘prehistory’ of the Dionysian.

Ass can be a general term of abuse, connoting above all stupidity and dullness or slowness. All humans, from a higher perspective, are idiotic. To the concept of ass, the distinctive braying is ‘i-a’, thus ‘jay’ or yes – the ass stands for indiscriminate affirmation, lack of taste. The ass sometimes replaces such meanings as stubborn, enduring, and even intelligent; as a weight-bearing creature, the figure of the ass sometimes overlaps with the more familiar image of the camel. The festival of the ass is akin to one aspect of the Greek ‘Dionysian’ festival – the suspension of cultural and social order; likewise, there are Medieval traditions with a similar theme. Also, the ass is made sacred in some myths of Dionysus. Moreover, worshipping the ass is akin to the final nihilistic stages of religion, but here in a joyous and festive spirit.

A modern conception of space means the vast, mostly empty and cold distances between stars or planets – an excellent symbolic vehicle for his notions of the pathos of distance (‘too distant star’), the infrequent appearance of greatness, nobility, friendship, solitude (the image of the star emitting light into the darkness, also notice the allusion to solar flares) or untimeliness (‘the light of the stars needs time’ ). Likewise, it serves to convey the cosmic insignificance of human beings and even the chaotic nature of reality overall. Similarly, also the methods of astronomy are employed: not seeing the stars as ‘above you’ – that is not transcendent in nature.

In its primary sense, atheism is the positive assertion of the non- existence of anything like a god. To be sure, nothing like a god exists as either an independent physical or a transcendent entity. If gods are symbolic expressions of human ideals, however, then atheism in this essential sense is changed by the commitment to the Dionysian model.

<|endoftext|>

Abandoning a belief in a transcendent God is a step forward culturally. However, in general, the issue of a god’s existence is far from the most critical aspect. More important are questions like the following: (i) what does the need to posit a god’s existence say about the believer?  (ii) What does atheistic questioning say about the metaphysical commitments of the questioner? So, for example, atheism ‘today’ stays in the tradition of the ascetic ideal. Likewise, the hidden implication of theism with science, language or morality means that unbelief is often blind to its causes and consequences. (iii) What ideals are posited in a belief, or despite a lack of faith, in a god? The arising of a Christian idea of God is discussed, as far as Christianity is not the function of the survival, much less the growth, of a people. Moreover, Christianity is not just atheism, nor just any theism, and therefore atheism is not necessarily anti-Christian. Nineteenth-century English moral philosophy, for example, stays Christian even if it rejects theism.

Atomism is a theory of nature that posits as the ultimate constituent parts of nature small, indivisible particles that move, collide, and combine in space. The argument begins with Democritus and becomes an integral part of Epicureanism.  It is revived in the early modern period as the basis of many philosophical materialisms and mechanistic accounts of physics. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, atomism received a boost because of the success of the science of chemistry, and likewise its role in models of thermodynamics. As a comprehensive account of nature, atomism always had specific weaknesses, such

 way to the end, the best being is only human. So Christian morality calls for a revaluation of the value of an aspect of the social order, namely, the human. Human beings, then, are characterized by their Ripple. Human beings are valued for their 'mobility' – their tight-knit, unified identity and motivation. This is manifested in their morphology and function. There are two fundamental strands. First, the notion of soul in particular; second, the metaphysics of mind that is the investigation of the 'free spirit'. The first concerns are the claims made by metaphysicians about the nature of soul, and their reciprocal dependence upon one another. The power of the will to power is a crucial feature of the account of language. The second strand involves the notion of fate. If physics can account for the first wave of thought concerning introspection, then history and culture can follow suit. Whole sections of this book deal with the notion of fate, from the 'fine art of fate' to the 'fine art of life' and thus the basis of many sections of philosophy. There is an extended discussion of the concept of fate in section 17. There is a periodical treatise on Wagner, published in 1888, where the theme of fate begins to gain in the popular consciousness.

<|endoftext|>

Third, there are later works by Nietzsche that are, for a conceptualisation of the self that does not involve positing metaphysical commitments to facts or values. This is known as the ‘nonsense day’ and is used to justify and even protect behaviour. For example, a sense is an observation or a belief held stubbornly by a small group. 

<|endoftext|>

The most sustained treatment of the theme of fate is presented in the Treatise of GM - that the aim here is to explore the sovereign right of the philosopher (or scribe, for that matter) to refuse to take part in the decision-making (or interpretation) of events and events are, in effect, fate. This theme is further advanced by the treatise's conclusion that there is enough 'wrong' with the way things are. For example, 'Too much of the future' brings with it a 'bad conscience'. Likewise, 'Too much is fate' brings with it a bad conscience. In a spirit of equality, a bad conscience is defined against some aspect of who and what are considered as 'above' one another. This alignment is expressed in terms of the 'one against' who is to become 'too similar'. That is, the opposite wills.selves the opposite will, in fact, be similarly tarred as one against. What is similar is not opposite, but identical in some respects. Correspondingly, these values arise together to form a 'society' (for that sake of psychology, at least). Thus, the opposite will to power is akin to a society of drives: they both equal one thing (i.e. different). But what is opposed is not against God, but against something.

Similarly, human beings now act as though they are one body against, against, against, against all that is feminine, and thus against all experience. This is feminine. Amor fati is merely anamorphosism, the revaluation of whole sections of the human towards the feminine. The purpose of all this is to make the ideal of feminine characteristics – such as the feminine ideal of the thinker (such as the feminine need or courage; feminine beauty or feminine sensuality; feminine beauty and feminine tragedy); or feminine genius or serenity. All these things are feminine, though somewhat differently endowed, by feminine mutations.

The notion of mythic symbols represents the mechanism by which culture might be unified, and thus share the basis for communication concerning that which is genuinely significant. Also, concepts of metaphor, symbol, and allegory as mechanisms by which communication might be able to surpass its built-in limits. So, for example, the ‘man of intuition’ discussed at the end of ‘Truth and Lies’ occupies a world where things are liberated from their bondage under functional needs and accompanying values. Furthermore, the concept of Dionysian can also be considered through this fashion. This ‘inspired’ state is thus key to the noble attempt to communicate to and transform others. However, the free spirit sometimes needs to avoid communication even to his or her closest friends as making his or her feelings known could lead to a form of despising.

 way of destruction, of all the contemplative or protective aspects of culture, educational institutions or the concept of sin.

Moreover, this destruction has a decisive relationship to the creation of the saint (and, specifically, the Christian) – that is, the saintly aspect of his or her role in the modern state; her as the instrument of his or her power to influence others, and thus also in his or her own image. Likewise, in the ‘creation of the philosopher’, the role of the philosopher in art and morality is implicitly acknowledged. The creation of the saint is a stage, a process – yes, but a process that very much needs to begin.

A traditional definition of the philosopher is anyone who 'promises' or 'says'; the philosopher of the future is anyone who can present the comprehensive theory of the real, without resorting to ideal fictions of form or substance. This recognition of the philosopher and his or her existence is in contradiction to the Socratic maxim. Therefore, the philosopher of the future is anyone who can present the comprehensive theory of the real and stable, without the pursuit of the absurd. Moreover, the philosopher of the future is responsible for the notion of being or not Being, and thus also for the analysis of values. So, the philosopher of the future is anyone who can present the comprehensive tocrodent, to the point that this comprehensive is seriously meant’; the comprehensive must be someone who can present the pure and not-soapy essence of life to others. This idea of the philosopher as the 'saying to God' is in contradiction to the Socratic maxim. Therefore, the philosopher of the future is anyone who can present the pure and not- soapy essence of life to God, and not to God, before the advent of God. This means, though, that the comprehensive brings with it a dangerous form of life: the conviction that is 'Too Stupid to Believe'.

Comprehensiveness is a concept without a single term to name it. Comprehensiveness describes an individual who encompasses and can employ a variety of different states, drives or types of knowledge. Thus, comprehensiveness stands especially in contrast to the specialization typical of modern intellectual life. It is related to the idea of the multiple (the human soul is various), and to the wanderer who has no fixed cultural home and sees and takes part in much. Comprehensiveness also describes the various abilities, all separately developed in human prehistory, that needed to come together to make the thinker. Analogously, it either links to the emergence of the comprehensive ‘individual’ who can live ‘beyond’ the morality of some old, decaying culture. The philosopher must be able to see with many eyes, to view things from many perspectives; to develop this ability of  ‘brief habits’—similarly, the ability to function concerning, for example, philosophy, business or science.

<|endoftext|>

Comprehensiveness is thus a feature of a future philosophical nobility, to be distinguished from the nobility of a narrowly perfected culture, as well as from the anti-culture of the historical sense. This historical sense is a kind of comprehensiveness but without discrimination, without any setting of limits. Such an ideal requires dangerous experiences to enable judgements about the value of modes of life. Greatness is judged in fact by the ability for comprehensiveness. Comprehensiveness thus describes a height that is not that of abstraction and represents an overall responsibility for the development of the human, and which can use
