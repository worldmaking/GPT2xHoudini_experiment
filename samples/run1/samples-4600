 its values. It should be noted that Leiblichkeit has the same root as rein or Reinet (pure, purity) and these concepts have something of a moral and religious connotation.

Cleanly, to be sure. – One who dresses in clean- washed rags covers cleanly, to be sure, but still raggedly. Its point is to distinguish between a literal and figurative meaning of cleanliness – the latter corresponds to something like nobility. In other words, a condition of the possibility of nobility is not wealth, but freedom from abject poverty. Analogously, the cleanliness of a child ‘transforms’ itself into something more spiritual later, including ‘purity’.

<|endoftext|>

Another aspect of the symbolic meaning of cleanliness is honesty. That is, purity now refers to a set of intellectual practices that refuse unclear thought practices, particularly those that defer to a metaphysical beyond (e.g. religious institutions and the beliefs they embody).  The notion that religion (Christianity in particular) is not clean enough for the spirit is made again. This functions as a kind of summary of the critical reflection of Christianity. Particularly pertinent to this image is the crucial thought of Christianity in terms of its darkness or murkiness, that is its willingness to be dishonest. Also bound up in the perception of uncleanliness is Christianity’s association with the herd or slaves; its attempt to crush nobility; its moral attitudes are often masking lecherous desires; its contempt for the body creates filth (e.g. in sexuality) – indeed, even cleanliness is seen as sensuousness, that is as filth.  Cleanliness as innocence is, of course, also a reference to the blood of Christ as cleansing one of sin; the ironic point here is that the Christian idea of sin is what creates the ‘dirt’ in the first place.

However, the type of uncleanliness is not the worst thing; the worst thing is shallowness. This is a typical characteristic of modernity, especially in Germany. It is the product of a democratic community. The point concerns distance; that is, a herd is defined not by numbers, or cleanliness in an ordinary sense, but by thinking, speaking, and acting as one, and by assuming equality (e.g. touching). This is unclean in a spiritual sense because it must involve falsifications or simplifications, passivity, and weakness, and because it leads to a stagnation of the human. Thus, what is unclean is ‘common’. Once a work has been produced (e.g. an act done, a book published) then it is in the collective sphere; if saw at all, it becomes universal. Nobility cannot be judged, then, by acts or works. Only a noble reserve, solitude and self-respect could keep its spiritual cleanliness.

The emphasis of cleverness is on both a patient caution and on a subtle, hidden, and often inventive calculation bent upon reaping the rewards. The concept contrasts both with the ‘human of intuition’ in his or her abundance and beauty (‘On Truth and Lies’), with wisdom and with great foolishness. This cleverness, seen as a characteristic of modernity (regarding education, business or industry, scholarship and practical morality). 

<|endoftext|>

Cleverness also describes those subtle tactics designed to influence moral feelings or keep religious practices or ideas. Likewise, it is priestly shrewdness that organized the weak into the herd by which the will to power is, in a small way, stimulated to life. Not all usages have these moral overtones, though. Cleverness lies at the origin or maintenance of the state and state institutions, and the agonistic institutions of Greece. Likewise, through the discipline of manners, a shrewdness even in the body can be cultivated. This cleverness is an element in those virtues that traces back to the animal.

<|endoftext|>

Shrewdness is honoured both by the noble and by those of ressentiment but for different reasons. Only for the latter is it a condition of existence, of preservation. These notions of caution and ressentiment allow us to distinguish between the lower and higher concept of cleverness.

The closest things can be considered with "good neighbours'. While the philosophical tradition tends to chase after the prominent and most distant questions of existence, and particularly of other transcendent or ideal presences, we should pay attention to this world and life. Because of continuous becoming, not only are these big questions hopelessly unsolvable, but even the ways of life typical of

 its human aspect, with its 'free spirit' who can employ reason effectively and joyfully. Also, the notion of freedom of will is in partusion both to the concept of suffering and also to the notions of guilt and punishment. The account of nature is thus revealed to be a general one, and not specific to Greece.

The account of music is something that is associated with exploration, with the various ways that organisms (birds, fish, air, water) have together assembled a valuable collective for the purpose of music. One such application is an ensemble of sounds. Playing is understood as a specific mode of living, and is thus an ensemble of affects. The notion of Dionysian or Socratic music, or as a culture struggling against the urge to dance, is an essential source.

<|endoftext|>

The notion of music is not, as one might have expected, exclusively about the ascending and ascending of Dionysus. Second, music is the mechanism by which that culture, grown stagnant, is eventually undone through the creation of Dionysus. Third, music as the mechanism for the growth of barbarians and marauding around the world; again, this is music as a mechanism for the growth of cunning against.

<|endoftext|>

The notion of music is not, as one might have expected, exclusively about the ascending and ascending of Dionysus. Second, there are several significant errors. First, the simplification of the concept of ‘music’. The concept of music, for example, is not something that is somehow disassociated from the real (i.e. does not denote a reality), but something that is disassociated in some way (ith without a ‘finger of god’). The real is that the comprehensive dominance of the earth Kingdom of the earth is not an ‘accident’ but is a transformation. Second, nothing can be understood as chaos without the ‘wheel’ being a simplification. The existing class order is not the problem of ‘classes’ but of the accident itself. A third reason for the simplification of view is that some aspects of the Dionysian ideal are incorrect, such as the notion of the ‘need’ of the noble to be the ‘god of childbirth’. A fourth reason is that the analysis of accidents is incomplete without having a historical context. This is because the analysis of causes and effects must involve an ‘intelligent principium’, and does not arise from any immediate necessity or meaning. Such an intelligent principium is Parmenides yrinthinus. Active before Christianity, the purpose of this noble motivation was to repress the philosopher. However, as the meaning of the term becomes understood, the need for repress becomes explicit.

The affirmative and negative of any hypothesis are compared and contrasted, along with a central idea of the self as the creator of, and initiator of, reality. From this, a ‘closest contradiction’ is developed: primordial chaos is a means of preserving this form of reality, while the philosopher must ‘crucify’ it for the self to believe in it. Such a state will involve a multiplicity of power and great suffering, and thus also corruption. A few sections later, the notion of value becomes fundamental. A drama about the acquisition of beauty isopoulosior. The struggle for the fate of the beautiful is Hera Maximilian in Petite Trismegaire. The chorus protects us from the images of the rumpus of culture,  but also liberates some for the higher world. Beauty drives suffering also. Beauty urges one towards procreation.

Beauty is a quality of the ideal (e.g. the gods) that a human value sets for itself; thus, beauty is a human measure, ‘given’ to the world, by means of which it affirms or even worships itself. Thus, the metaphor of everything being a mirror to one’s beauty. The spectacle of ascending life is beautiful; degeneration is ugliness. As again in Plato, an attraction in itself is not the goal or endpoint, but instead either a sign of health or that which ‘lures’ one towards further creation (the soft voice of beauty and wisdom and life personified). Thus, for example, experiences are the seductress, teasing with beauty; or beauty is a culture’s imagined happiness; likewise, the beauty of the over human. Such disinterest is both physiologically impossible (or at least unlikely), but more importantly also a perverse conception of what is beautiful (‘immaculate perception’). Instead, what is given up for the sake of beauty is only the ‘hero’s will’, and

Butterfly is a vital image with far-reaching but not always clear implications. Broadly, the image of butterfly is in a negative, though also in a positive way. The critical meaning of the former is thoughtless living in and for the present. Butterfly is thus modern humanity with its newspapers and petty politics. There are two aspects to the positive meaning. First, the butterfly is childlike, innocent, and therefore able to relate to its world without the heaviness of values. Second, the butterfly is a standard mode of existence, lightly and laughingly affirming of its conditions and its fate. The butterfly, in this sense, is also eager for growth. The butterfly is used in this sense, but now with an emphasis on the problematic sacrifices that are the precondition of such growth. The idea of cocoon is about the Apollonian cultural drive being forced to disguise itself as mania for persuasion, but re-emerging in modernity.

Caesar is a Roman general, politician and then ‘dictator’ of Rome. To mention Caesar and Napoleon together metaphorize instances of something exceptionally free, characterised by scepticism and the throwing off faiths, a moment of beauty and genius. Caesar, the tyrant, is thus also an example of the opportunities and dangers of decadence, for the highest type is always ‘five paces from tyranny’. It is precisely that danger which is their condition of growth.

'Camel' is the first of the three 'transformations of the spirit'. Importantly, the spirit as camel is already a transformation, and not a default position of the human. The camel wishes the bear as heavy a burden as possible, to feel its strength and test that strength. The weights are those of the deliberate assumption of humility and self-mockery, confining oneself to a specialization, discovering dangerous or unpleasant truths, rejecting the pity of others, and overcoming one's overcoming (i.e. departing a cause when it is victorious). In other words, the camel is the free spirit as far as he or she recognizes these states as burdens; exhibits veneration towards the burdens, that interprets them as valuable; and, knows him or herself to be strong enough to bear them.

The images of cat relate to the cat family from domestic cats to tigers and lions. The lion stands for exceptional strength, ravenous desire, strong will to power, but is primarily destructive and only prefiguring creation. The figure of the lion is an echo of Plato’s analogy, where the lion stands for the thump’s element of the soul and spiritedness. The lion figures prominently hint the sign that the days of loneliness are over. Also, the symbol of lions is as combining power with gentleness.

The tiger is the most common beast mentioned in ‘Animal’s Bizarre Rejects’, and is now included as a symbol of all that is ‘wild’ in nature. The tiger’s wildness is not tamed by either its individual or collective will, and this causes it to be cruel to others. The shrewd and cunningest of hunters, the shrewdest of negotiators, the shrewdest of all. It is thus achingly repeating itself time and again, ‘The tiger is achingly’. It is thus a saying that whatever is sacred is by definition cowardly, that is it still cowardly because it has a ‘long’ way to go. Likewise, the tiger is achingly repeating itself in human form: If it
