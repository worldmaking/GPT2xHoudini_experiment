 allegal values that we think of as significant others:  thus, the priest is a responsible creditor. Likewise, the priest is a representative of some divinity, such as Apollonian cultural production.

Even your best love is only a rapturous allegory. There is a concept of love revealed that goes beyond either of these two senses. Because of this, there is a false sense of security and Dionysian. Essential asides reveal.

It is repeated that all permanence is a poet’s allegory, and the poets lie too much. All that is transient is merely allegory’. ‘Poet’ here does not only mean an artist in verse, but also anyone who posits permanence (the metaphysics of substance, or the theology of a god), since that is only a poetic device. Such lying allegories are not contrasted to any direct, non- poetic statement of facts. A model of language that values clarity, directness and the absence of imagery is even further from the capacity to speak the truths of, say, will to power. Instead, the contrast is with ‘higher’ allegories of time and becoming. Here, on every allegory, you ride to every truth. Similarly, only in dance can we tell the allegory of the highest things. Something like ‘inspiration’, then, is needed for such images to cease being a lie and reach to their proper symbolic functioning.

The love of one’s fate, specifically, a gratitude towards all that makes up the situation that I inhabit, and which has produced me in the way that I am. The root of the idea is found in the notion of ‘antiquarian history’. The interconnectedness of all things and events, this ‘all’ is effectively the whole course of history as far as that history ‘passes’, in part, through an individual. Amor fati is a ‘formula for greatness’. My love or gratitude comes from the fact that this fate produces me and does so as being capable of affirming myself and capable of having a creative role in the future.

<|endoftext|>

The idea is closely allied to that of affirmation more generally:  to say yes to this situation is the only way of saying yes to oneself, and vice versa. It is related to the affirmation of eternal recurrence. Only an individual who embodied a healthy and ascending life; was spiritually attuned to such life (e.g. not deceived about themselves); also, could ‘redeem’ the past and present as if it were a product of their will, could genuinely love one’s fate. As such, accident, or chance (in any ordinary sense) is not relevant. Likewise, necessity is no cause for distress, for nothing can befall the lover of fate that is not also a product of the creative will.

Several thinkers argued that any hierarchical framework of political, economic, legal, or social power must be harmful to human beings. Also, revolutionary figures and groups in the nineteenth century and beyond believed that political institutions could not be reformed but had to be dismantled. Although Rousseau was not an anarchist, some aspects of his thinking were essential for later anarchist thought.

Although anarchism appears to be intellectually opposed to other modern ideas such as democracy, equality or even socialism, is in fact of a piece with them. Anarchism is founded on reaction and ressentiment, remains moralistic, expresses a deep pessimism towards the future, and is founded on the belief in a future in which everything will be righted. Anarchism involves the overcoming of the instincts of domination of the barbarian. It projects these instincts onto those who value life and lead a healthy and festive life. Anarchism is founded on the concept of work, association, or community. It thus amounts to an across-coming-together of the will to power and to power.

Animal defers to tier, and with different connotations, Bestie. In general, it is the figure of animality to describe aspects of the human, for example, virtues, vices, drives or types. Sometimes, however, the human is described as having an ungodly sense of direction, that is, direction as from a higher perspective, more focused on than commonly associated with religious or theological concepts. In Christianity, the noble purpose of the church is not the ascetic, but the cleansing of the human of this sinful animality. The idea is that this specific kind of discipline, its endpoint, and its student will find deeply disturbing.

 allegic sequences are metaphysically true, and the arising of a moral expectation is a false recognition of pain. Also, these various analyses of moral are themselves an product of the action of perception (interpretation). Therefore, to develop new morals is to create new values. The formation of a people and its culture determine the first acts of creation; later, in the context of the decadence of the former, God willing creates greatness not in numbers, but in feeling and in form. This process either replicates itself or leads to a desire for resources (for growth and power; or, the latter is a mythatically high culture where beauty and clarity of form are an over-rated virtue). Or it can be creative in a way that action cannot repay. The idea is closely allied to that of the renewed sense of the 'new self' or 'spirit of gravity' – and, thus, a creation of the spirit of gravity towards the first object of faith, namely God.

The third strand of thought concerning creation is the notion of sublimation, in which a supernatural (or at least unproven) idea isfalls under the category of 'boleo'. There are two critical aspects to the sublimation of Christianity. First, the attempt to revalue originality while at the same time preserving the illusion of originality. Christianity is a continuous process with no end, no end in sight. Second, Christianity is to be judged in historical sense from scratch. Christian concepts are not separable but essential. Third, and closely related, the evaluation of values also has to begin with a historical consideration of a historical Jesus – this is Christianity as ‘historical’. This revaluation of importance results in the notion of a future purpose in life,  the kind of man or woman who – despite suffering or degeneration – continues to produce value. 

<|endoftext|>

There are three aspects of the evaluation of value. First, will to power. A modern evaluation of a library is full of people who, in some way, deserve to be named. The great man only needs to borrow a copy of the library from a rival, and he or she has that right to read and make use of. Second, it is the right of the noble or the masters to give names, to make servants of the class. This is both because the master has made a slave of the class, but also in the expression 'the slaves will rise at a good conscience'. The sense of a future of equal rights and flourishing is generated, not in the trivial sense of a historical text, but in the spirit of a productive subtlety in the war against corruption. Third, it is about the nobility of becoming, of the resentment of becoming, and of the positive effects of breeding and reproduction on organisms. A class system is, then, for as long as it serves this end – regardless of whether its origin happens to be intrinsic or extrinsic. Historically, from out of these hierarchies, moral values were developed, either as images of the distinctive virtues of the various classes, especially the highest – or in reaction against them (the slave revolt in morality). Thus, any deliberate attempt at the creation of new morals must involve a change of class structure. Often, a system of values will outlive the class structure from which it arose. A future in which the necessity of class differences will be appreciated and welcomed, and a new ‘caste’ of cultural leaders will appear. The existence of such healthy differences among individuals or groups is felt as the pathos of distance.

Any number of other symbols may refer to this concept of cleanliness, such as fresh air, clarity, brightness, health, nakedness. Cleanliness is opposed to filth, dirt, murky waters. It should be noted that Leiblichkeit has the same root as rein or Reinet (pure, purity) and these concepts have something of a moral and religious connotation.

Cleanly, to be sure. – One who dresses in clean- washed rags covers cleanly, to be sure, but still raggedly. Its point is to distinguish between a literal and figurative meaning of cleanliness – the latter corresponds to something like nobility. In other words, a condition of the possibility of nobility is not wealth, but freedom from abject poverty. Analogously, the cleanliness of a child ‘transforms’ itself into something more spiritual later, including ‘purity’.

<|endoftext|>

Another aspect of the symbolic meaning of cleanliness is honesty. That is, purity now refers to a set of intellectual practices that refuse unclear thought practices, particularly those that defer to a metaphysical beyond (e.g. religious institutions and the beliefs they embody).  That is, a culture can now be saved from itself if

 allegory of the self and its endpoint, the spectator. The spectator, thus, does not belong to the authentic or creative stage of thought, but is merely instruments on the part of the philosopher – and this is an abuse of the concept of 'music' – serves as a 'guide' to the real and productive uses of dance.

Also, the ideal of a democratic, modernised and free Europe is a key. The union of the races was a key theme, along with several ascetic practices. Finally, the union of the masculine and feminine was a necessity, a moment of beauty and genius. UTC is also a significant date.

The symbol of 'dance' is significant also, both for its enormous variation across cultural and historical strata, and the frequent appearance of 'dance', 'dance' or whatever is associated with 'life'. This is manifested in 'our' (i.e. human forms of life) and 'our' is characterized by 'dance' (‘immortal' is a reference to the dancing!), and in the fact that the symbols of dance and leap are employed to describe a life that could not be'. On a literal interpretation of dance, the dancer is already a slave, in which case the idea of subordination is necessary. Instead, 'dance' is understood to be a calling, a state or an activity in which something is deliberately not there but again, nothing is there but a dance. This is akin to a walk in theness of an idea or culture, an occurrence which is not represented by a dance. Indeed, even the concept of a 'doer' is something excluded from the concept of turn – that is a philosopher must be a doer to be sure).

The dithyramb was in ancient Greek literature a choral hymn to Dionysus, set to music and dance. The dithyramb, following Aristotle, was thus the original form of Greek tragedy. Only fragments of dithyrambs survive, along with observations concerning characteristic rhythmic, formal, and formal qualities, but without any clear evidence as to how they were performed.

A dog is a domesticated, and degraded, beast of prey. Thus, it is both suddenly aggressive, and contemptible in its display of cowardliness, distress, or anger. Having been a slave, it has become nothing other than a slave. Thus, the dog is a potent symbol of the resistance of the domesticated to the will to power, and exemplary of the type of resistance that the role of religion in European history has shown. The dog is a crucial symbol of the resistance of the noble to the Christian, who is also a slave. The dog’s famous loyalty is nothing more than submission, and it is thus no more capable of love, but for a different reason, than the cat. This submission is akin to a human’s religious feeling – obedience out of fear, or long discipline. The dog is something that is supposed to be wretched so that its owner can feel important or influential. The sheepdog is an obvious metaphor of the sublimation of beauty and beauty, as well as the ideal of a healthy and honest culture. The firedog is noisy, spectacular, but irrelevant – and thus like the socialist revolution and similar events. The critical moments are quiet, creative of values. Zarathustra tells the story of a traveller accidentally stepping on a sleeping dog, making enemies of those who could be friends.

The term dream is used to characterize the Apollonian. The critical distinction here is not between dreaming and being awake; the dream is employed to understand a certain domain of culture, and particularly of art. The dream is a self-created world, one that is created to be aligned with our instincts of preservation and our need to justify our existence and our values. The dream is not merely an illusion – we can be aware of ourselves dreaming – but the validity of the beautiful forms that we dream are derived from their role in our health and our preservation, and not in their truth-speaking. In a general psychological theory of the dream, dreams are the way to make sense of stimuli through a retrospective ascription of causation. But this precisely is how we live our waking lives also. The analysis changes focus, to dreams as the space
