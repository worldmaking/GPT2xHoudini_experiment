 or it is a product of the action of perception (interpretation). Similarly, our analysis of causes and effects must first separate and make discrete that which is the cause and that which is an effect, from out of a continuum.

Control and Self-control denote reperching, among others. The idea of having control, especially over the self, is an essential source of the feeling of power. This can be in an ascetic sense, involving subordination of the self to an impossible or metaphysical ideal. Or it can be in the spirit of a productive subtlety in the war against oneself (self-overcoming). Self-control can also be associated with courage or strength.

Convalescence means the course of suffering and surviving from illnesses caused by physiologies or cultures. The sickness led from cultures, in a sense, is by no means entirely metaphorical - that is ideas, beliefs, values, or modes of life that one has inherited and with which he or she is surrounded. When we talk about ‘convalescence’, it usually links to this second kind of illness, and its overcoming, in mind. Convalescence as an overcoming is thus contrasted to comforting as a relieving of suffering. Convalescence is also part of the cycle of creative states, linked to exhaustion and the need for repose.

A conviction is a belief, held stubbornly to be 'unqualified truth'. There is a concept of conviction which looks to be rooted in the nature of courage or knowledge. Convictions are a form of opinion, represented as ‘a conviction in oneself’. There is also a notion of atheism which denies the reality of guilt and any ability to sleep at night. Convictions are a means of comforting Skepticism with a notion of a ‘wholeness’.

<|endoftext|>

A conviction is tested. If it is to be a ‘faith, a science’ or a ‘science’ – and if it has any positive consequences – then it is a ‘faith in science’. Convictions are a means of cheerfulness to fate or life. The idea is that science and its implications will one day be impossible for a previous positivism.

Courage and bravery are an ancient virtue that we need to appreciate and revalue. Courage is the ability to stick firmly to life and the real, and not to borrow one’s beliefs and values from imaginary other worlds or modes of being. Likewise, it is courage not to manufacture one’s beliefs and values by a fearful negation of becoming, uncertainty and suffering, which are the conditions of life and the real. Such courage in the type is represented by Epictetus (the Stoic philosopher who had been a slave) and contrasts it with the Christian slave characterized by faith and hope in a different life. A few sections later, courage is proclaimed as a key ‘future virtue’: the arrogance to understand and not be afraid of the world. This courage is not dissimilar to generosity. Thus, the courageous type of thinker who is aware of the ‘cruelty of the intellectual conscience’, which does not simplify but insists upon multiplicity and perspective. Such courage is a form of self-overcoming. Zarathustra talks about those among his disciples who are too cowardly to change the direction of their willing and thus soon abandon him in favour of their contentment. Likewise, it is Zarathustra’s courage that tells the Spirit of Gravity to get off his back.

Happy because unconcerned with past or future, or not stricken by heavy thoughts (here, chewing the cud means focused in the present moment, not prone to nausea). The cow is also patient and seeing, and thus a metaphor for reading and interpretation as an art lost in modernity; rumination means to consider and contemplate without hurry. The cow is trusting, not slighted by distance or change; warm and reassuring like a faithful companion. The cow is an essential religious symbol in many Eastern religions: the ‘voluntary beggar’, learning contentment from a herd of cows, is a portrait of Jesus as a displaced and misunderstood Eastern sage. The cow’s calm is a possible and worthy response to nihilism and the degeneration of humanity.

There are two layers of meaning to the term 'creation'.  First, 'creation" signifies to the religious or theological terminology, but its use is not confined to such contexts; second, 'creation' is a slightly more 'ordinary' term about concepts, such as 'making', 'crafting' or producing'.

 or is in contradiction of common modern practices, values, or practices. It is anti-life, in all its forms. Here it is repeated many, many times: First, the ascetic ideal is a 'doer' pursued after by Zarathustra and his disciples; 'goofy' practices, like the withdrawal of patsy or feminine emotions – these conditions would allow a reader to interpret or apply positivist evidence). Second, the ideal of the Christian ascetic priest is lost with the ‘cultural philistine’; the ideal of the responsible adolescent becomes living in the present moment with the ‘pessimistic’ future. Third, the real Zarathustra, who is not afraid of the future, and does not tolerate becoming, reserves his reserves of will for later use. This idea of courage and untimeliness as qualities of a healthy form of life.

The image of the cross is commonly associated with the Eastern religions; thus, it becomes a symbol of individualism and the self-overcoming of faith. Also, it is a cross that serves as a padlocked device for encrypted communication (i.e. without the need to decrypt or memorize). Thus, the eagle is thus a form of anarchic-scale socialisation. The eagle is a bird of prey. Birds and especially the eagle, thus, need to be protected from; likewise, the dove needs to be protected from the Persian tyrant. The eagle must also be strong enough to take the plunge and crash land on its back, to prove its worthiness with the people. The Persian general, King of the Ostrich, was particularly protective of the eagle; likewise, the eagle’s hunt is direct, straight down; it is thus, a ‘pyramid’ within which all humans live.

The eagle is one of the animals associated in mythology with the eagle, the eagle having a higher spiritual responsibility than the human and derived its strength from the innocence of innocence. The eagle is also the figure of that eagle who warns the serpent about its denigration of life, which is the ‘god of destruction’. The serpent is represented by the serpent form, which is slightly more energetic and has broader uses. Also, the eagle is the figure of that serpent who shares many similar characteristics and is also in opposition to the serpent. Also, the eagle is the figure of that serpent who still cannot cut, chew or ripen its self-respect. Thus, the eagle is a totem pole for all humans, and also a platform for those who despise the beast.

The eagle is the most common bird mentioned in mythology. Birds of prey include the eagle, the raven, the eagle-preyed perennial; the dove is a light bird who can swoop, and land, before its prey. The eagle must be agile and its need for protection, as well as its need to reorient, be agile in its ascent.

The eagle view is that of the eagle trying to interpret and justifying his or her actions and these values – and not just any interpretations or purposes – that it has for its actions and this misinterpretation or over-sensitivity. Thus, the eagle is someone who can apply the principles of religion to their actions, and who can take on the challenges of his or her life in a way that is not bound up in other aspects of his or her life, including heightening her joys and disasters.

The eagle can view things from a different perspective. The eagle can look to things from a different perspective. The critical moments are quiet, direct, and not afraid of the world. These are the moments of beauty, genius, or greatness that are not stirred by or antagonistic to any other perspective. These are the moments of pure sensuality that are not slandered as ‘ironic’ but are refocused on in becoming. Such moments are the moment of beauty and genius that is not afraid of the world.

The allusion to the eagle, the ruffian, the serpent is especially aimed at since it is related to the eagle’s serpent form of agility. Also, the snake is a little too subtle in its move. It needs to be understood as a certain type of bird or creature that it is supposed to be able to aid its owner with, to its distress or delight. The eagle is the most experienced of the herd people of the area, and it is also the type of animal that a herd of sheep can be. The serpent is the opposite of this ideal which is noble in aspect but deceptive in spirit. Thus, the serpent is the one who can deceive the human into thinking that it is helping itself to the knowledge it

 or such. The concept can also be used as a kind of shorthand for communication (medium).

Similarly, human values or beliefs are collections of forces or individuals that span dozens of nations and hundreds of years (e.g. religious or theological meaning). There are several aspects. The individual Scotchman has no real home and has to find a way to preserve and expand his or her existing ways of life. Also, while culture is productive by returning to the original principle of the self, the return is a disfigured fragment of the whole system. Moreover, if one rigorously rejects the hypothesis of a world, then ultimately one also must rigorously refuse the notion of appearance itself. Appearance only makes sense to something ‘behind’ or ‘beyond’ it. The idea of appearance becomes transformed into the temptation to pity. The ancient Greeks lived in a world that was somehow miraculous, and thus they often gave miraculous results. However, such an experience as ‘appearance’ will only make one's appearance (and even that appearance itself is ugly). Instead, an appearance is everything that is not yet so, plus what is needed for life to return. This is metaphorically understood as the desire to see what is beneath. A world that is understood as being beneath is always going to be ugly, and will only make one’s sight painful.

Shining is defined as a display of power or strength, as opposed to merely being excellent. The classically feminine and noble tradition dresses themselves in noble attire, often with embroidered vests or bracelets, to symbolize reverence for the abstract and the feminine. Shining is also used in both Greek and Roman myth as evidence of the ability of clothing to symbolize a decadent life. The idea is that under the ideal of chicane, all but the nobility has been stripped of their symbolic meaning and, in socialism, there has been a social strife. In other words, both the productive and the destructive both occur simultaneously.

Both biological types and historical circumstances are temporary instruments available to a people – and behind any people, life itself is a marketplace – to try various forms of overcoming, including domination. The free spirit and ‘reaction’ must be able to ‘reverse’ his or her actions or results. The system of life – one whose power and happiness lies in the system – is fatally flawed. The system of life founded upon absolute dependence is thus a form of cruelty. Cruelty is a means of diverting the course of one’s life onto the right path, a way of living and a way of thinking very much like a monasterie – in both its chaos and its beauty. The system of life is particularly important in Greece, where Christianity is already a key characteristic.

The ape, then, is either an origin or disfigured mirror-image, of which we are ashamed. The ape is an imitator, unaware even of being an imitator, and which brings disrepute to the imitated.

Aphorisms is a brief, self-contained and striking piece of writing, usually gathered in sequences. Aphoristic writing was common in ancient literature and was employed by many authors. First, a random series of very brief sayings or epigrams, and second a series of longer pieces, each like a short study. There are a few added variations. Likewise, and regardless of the presence of an overarching theme to the series, aphorisms can speak to each other, as if they were short segments of a continuous piece of writing.
