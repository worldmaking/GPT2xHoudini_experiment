. It has a defining characteristic, then, that other religions, including most not named before us, exhibit a convalescence towards rationality that is involuntary and without cause. The key to this is the overcoming of the disinterest that now hangs around culture and social institutions. The account of causality in 'God only knows me' is the most frequent.

Sometimes, 'the universe' and 'the' are used as the proper metaphorical works of Plato. However, this 'world' is associated with the notion of substance, and with the continual encroachment of metaphysical thought and action into the realm of practical operations. This is a distorted conception of the nature of space and time that does not consider the universal as a whole, and thus also in its innumerable forms. Indeed, the cosmos is only possible because of the activity of the human, which is effectively a system of power and culture. Similarly, the universal is a comprehensive presence that does not allow the system to be dismantled.

The notion of cause and effect is not, as one might have expected, primarily in the context of a discussion of physics or metaphysics. In these contexts, either the nature of the problem or the nature of causality itself. In both contexts, a causal network – a way of thinking about the nature of matter – is the more obvious solution. The network is also the most natural – and arguably the mechanism by which the will to power is greatest. The notion of cause and effect is not, as yet, coherently understood as a system. In either case, a causal group is the mechanism by which that group affects or does so. That is, the network is the mechanism by which specific effects or causes are initially felt or understood. Likewise, the natural state of mind is a sequence of processes in time, one after the other, in which a ‘phenomenon of ill will’ is a setting for a genuine investigation of the origin and development of ill. Epiphanus is treated as a causal agent in the sense that he or she is the cause of one last thing: the waking person.

Control and Self-control denote reperching, among others. The idea of having control, especially over the self, is an essential source of the feeling of power. This can be in an ascetic sense, involving subordination of the self to an impossible or metaphysical ideal. Or it can be in the spirit of a productive subtlety in the war against oneself (self-overcoming). Self-control can also be associated with courage or strength.

Convalescence means the course of suffering and surviving from illnesses caused by physiologies or cultures. The sickness led from cultures, in a sense, is by no means entirely metaphorical - that is ideas, beliefs, values, or modes of life that one has inherited and with which he or she is surrounded. When we talk about ‘convalescence’, it usually links to this second kind of illness, and its overcoming, in mind. Convalescence as an overcoming is thus contrasted to comforting as a relieving of suffering. Convalescence is also part of the cycle of creative states, linked to exhaustion and the need for repose.

A conviction is a belief, held stubbornly to be 'unqualified truth'. There is a notion developed by the dangers and origin of conviction that one must be a 'noble traitor' to one's convictions. Convictions are opposed by both the genius of science and justice. Therefore, those who embrace science and justice are considered as the wanderer,  a thinker who has no home or 'destination' (both understood as convictions).

Courage and bravery are an ancient virtue that we need to appreciate and revalue. Courage is the ability to stick firmly to life and the real, and not to borrow one’s beliefs and values from imaginary other worlds or modes of being. Likewise, it is courage not to manufacture one’s beliefs and values by a fearful negation of becoming, uncertainty and suffering, which are the conditions of life and the real. Such courage in the type is represented by Epictetus (the Stoic philosopher who had been a slave) and contrasts it with the Christian slave characterized by faith and hope in a different life. A few sections later, courage is proclaimed as a key ‘future virtue’: the arrogance to understand and not be afraid of the world. This courage is not dissimilar to generosity. Thus, the courageous type of thinker who is aware of the ‘cruelty of the intellectual conscience’, which does not simplify but insists upon multiplicity and perspective. Such courage is a form of self-overcoming. Zarathustra talks about those among

The eagle is a bird of prey. Birds and especially the eagle, thus also stand for a kind of strength. The eagle can view the’s as bull’s, and likewise for its strength and agility. The serpent also shows its serpentine nature; this is as trying to overcome itself. Thus, the eagle is someone who can show self-denial and self-loathing when it disposes of itself and its Nest.

Anthropomorphism means to impose the form or qualities of the human onto something. The innumerable ways in which the histories of science, philosophy or religion have involved anthropomorphism. A key example is the concept of cause and effect in nature that this separation of cause and effect is an anthropomorphism, founded upon what is already a false characterisation of human action in terms of will. The whole of our knowledge of the world (including human beings) is anthropomorphic.

<|endoftext|>

On the one hand, then, these anthropomorphisms are illegitimate (they are ‘lies’), despite their enormous utility for human beings. On the other hand, there stays a danger of the destruction of culture through the overemphasis on critique (historicism, specialisation, etc.). The generation of greatness, the flourishing and advancement of the human depend upon such ‘lies’ being productive in the realm of culture.

It revolves around the contrast between this Jesus and the Christ figure disastrously generated by the Church Fathers, especially Paul.

Ape primate as akin to the animal aspect of humans’ pre-dates Darwin; with Darwin thought arises the notion of a common evolutionary ancestor. The ape is thus a representative of the whole human species, and therefore also a representative of Darwin’s critique of the ape. The ape is an animal’, but also a representative of the human species as a whole, and thus also of the danger that is bound to the development of a new ideal: the overcoming of the instinctive value-seeker and the overcoming of the saintliness of the human. The ape is also a representative of the various layers of human which still depend upon the animal for survival.

Aphorisms is a brief, self-contained and striking piece of writing, usually gathered in sequences. Aphoristic writing was common in ancient literature and was employed by many authors. First, a random series of very brief sayings or epigrams, and second a series of longer pieces, each like a short study. There are a few added variations. Likewise, and regardless of the presence of an overarching theme to the series, aphorisms can speak to each other, as if they were short segments of a continuous piece of writing.

The different rhythms of these various ways of writing and the different interpretative demands make on readers. The function of such writing as fully developed thoughts with either maximally compressed, or fragmentary, expression and an ‘immortal’ perfection of the form; aphorisms serve as a kind of test of readers; or an interpretative task set to readers, perhaps because the expression is deliberately incomplete.

Apollonian is named after the Greek God Apollo; this is one of three drives that it is a key to understanding cultural production and cultural change, from the ancient  Greek world on. The other two are Dionysian and Socratic. A  brief period in which the Apollonian and Dionysian work together produces ancient tragedy. The Apollonian is the origin of those cultural forms where beauty and clarity of form are emphasised (examples would be epic poetry, architecture, and sculpture), and the effects of calm or cheerfulness. Apollonian implicitly carries with it a metaphysical view concerning reality, that is, the belief that individual entities are ont

There are three critical aspects to the conception about death. The first and most apparent revolves around those values or beliefs that involve a denigration or even identification with the past or future. This value judgement involves an evaluation based upon current forms of human values or institutions, and upon any number of underlying, including biological processes. A key passage in this regard would be Zarathustra on the ‘preachers of death’. The rejection of life on the part of the ascetic priest is only clear; such asceticism is a means to carry on living despite suffering and degeneration. A related idea is a danger that the philosopher will meet in his or her attempt to overcome values. The death of the tight-rope walker, who made danger his ‘vocation’, is an example. Finally, metaphysics will often involve a conceptual rejection of becoming or a positing of facts and values as eternal. This is often described with metaphors of death: for example, the ‘mummified concepts.

<|endoftext|>

The ‘death of God’ is the second notion. Belief in God – and the values that go with such belief – is no longer possible or relevant within modernity. This is both a liberation but also a crushing blow (for it means that the burden of creating and justifying values falls upon the human). Here, ‘death’ means old, weak, irrelevant, but also historical, transient, and indeed not eternal. 

<|endoftext|>

The third concerns are either the notion of euthanasia or the relation of life to the thought of mortality. Some of the most beautiful passages are pleas for a ‘rational’ or ‘free’ death, one that precisely from out of ‘love of life’ does not allow the body entirely to outlive its usefulness and capacity for action. The thought of death should mix a drop of ‘foolishness’ into life, rather than gloom; this is partly because, without the need to come rapidly to a judgement about the significant issues for the sake of one’s eternal soul, the thought of our mortality frees us to have time for experimentation, and even for mistakes. Individuals should have more reasons to focus on life and joy in life rather than death.

The term of decadence with similar meanings include 'degeneration' and 'corruption'. 'Decadent' was a term of abuse used by French neo-classical or conservative critics against the romanticism of painters like Delacroix or novelists such as Hugo. Later, writers like Baudelaire adopted the term as their own, using it to express scepticism towards many dominant moral or political values. The usage of the word 'decadence' late in the late nineteenth centuries has represented the concepts of corruption, decline or degeneration date. Baudelaire is termed 'a typical decadency', and all references to him associate him with Wagner (Baudelaire was one of Wagner's champions in France). So, the meaning of 'decadence' is any period of cultural history – or any state of the human organism – which has lost its good taste and value judgement  (thus it is associated with pity; with Kantian duty; with Schopenhauer's quieting of the will), health and sureness of instinct, discipline and sense of a future. It is to be associated either with the decline of old cultures or with moral revolutions.

<|endoftext|>

The Kantian and Platonic-Christian metaphysical distinction between appearance and ‘true world’ is termed a ‘sign of decadence’. For all these reasons at Christianity is called a ‘monster of decadence’. Decadent cultures are exhausted cultures, and such cultures often exhibit a pathological over-sensitivity; indeed, often an inability not to respond, lacking the strength to inhibit one’s passions. Alternatively, the decadent culture can manifest itself as a craving for stimulation (for the voluptuous, the exotic, the dangerous). Importantly, this desire for stimulation is a symptom and not a cause – as those who react ascetically against such stimulation believe. Thus, decadence in the form of a culture of exhaustion that needs stimulation often precipitates a reaction, which is the ‘gathering gloom of the religious-moral pathos’.

<|endoftext|>

Most of the above could serve as an account of the notion of degeneration or corruption also. If there is a distinction to be drawn from decadence, degeneration tends to have a stronger physiological emphasis, and is used more often in specific cases (e.g. the instincts of the criminal,  or the degeneration of individual philosophers), and is sometimes associated particularly with
