 past, but it must now descend to its highest point. The story of the Israelites going up to Mount Sinai (Exodus) to seek the wisdom of the Lord is one of the oldest and most infamous. It is a subtle move towards higher human values but one that is founded upon necessity and resplendent in nature. It is related to the story of the cave, as well as to the symbolic mountains that are to the east of N’s Mount. The cave is a hidden place where the dead dance, to create human life is a humiliation and a perversion of the will to power.

Cialdini’s sound figure by Ernst Chaldini is a scientific demonstration of using the patterns formed by sand on a vibrating plate to visualize resonance. This is as representing a translation from vibration to image, but metaphorically an interpretation that is in no way obvious. and thus, does not allow us quickly to reverse the conversion back to the vibration.

The notion of chance is not, as one might have expected, primarily in the context of a discussion of physics or metaphysics. In these contexts, the much more common problem is the relationship between law, calculability, and necessity. The concept of chance reveals a vital ambiguity. On the one hand, history broadly and the life of an individual are subject to chance, meaning that there is no visible or comprehensible necessity and no setting of limits. Moreover, existence is characterized by chance in a grander sense: without overall or original purpose or meaning. Thus, even necessity has a chance-like character to it, since that necessity is not willed. Where its highest values are concerned, human cognition cannot accept chance; thus, the simplifying operation of cognition makes such chance appear as necessity and subjection to natural law, or as purpose or will. This simplification has moral consequences: the great idea of the innocence of chance is found at D13 in the context of a discussion of punishment. So, for example, simple mistakes are counted as crimes against God or justice, while the happy accident which is a great human being is accounted evil. Indeed, even the origin of those mental functions by which we think necessity (knowledge, reason, logic) lies in chance, that is in some fortunate event of prehistory in which a useful new characteristic or technique was stumbled upon. Likewise, the relationship between a genuine culture and the philosopher: without such a culture, the philosopher is a chance appearance like a ‘comet’. Moreover, without that culture – that is to say, in most times and places – the great human is crushed by chance, and this tempts one to pity. Nevertheless, love and gratitude towards this fate is needed.

<|endoftext|>

On the other hand, there is a necessity (or a fate) at work in cultural production, particularly art and philosophy. Here, the chance is defined against some underlying necessity, one that may be a willed achievement. For example, the rhetoric of the New Testament is not an ‘accident’ but is an intensification of a characteristic of the Jewish people. Again, the advent of Wagner could not be chance. Especially in the sphere of culture, greatness means allowing an underlying necessity, rather than incidental chances or irrelevant details, to guide one’s hand.

<|endoftext|>

Similarly, what is chance is fragmentary, aimless, or stunted; the response of health to this is a synthetic, compositional activity, making whole out of what is an immaculate conception of the task or possibilities of our age, and of the Dionysian state. The human must be liberated from chance as from priests; that is, freed from either a pessimistic assessment of human possibilities, from the endless diversion of the random and incidental, or from the rule of chance in human evolution.

Chaos is a significant ancient concept. The earth is ‘formless and empty’ before God’s creation. Similar ideas are common in other accounts of nature, such as Hesiod for whom Chaos was the first primordial deity. Eighteenth and nineteenth-century anthropology discovered that this myth pattern often took the form of a struggle against Chaos, which was often represented by a serpent or dragon (e.g. Zeus’ battle with Typhon). The notion of Chaos is on its own; scientific knowledge is a destruction of human nature and descent to Chaos. One of the meanings of the ‘evil’ principle is ‘chaos’. However, the struggle against the dragon is a struggle against a fixed order, and for Chaos. Thus, one must have chaos in one who can contradicting orders. Here, Chaos is not the enemy of but the principle of.

 past of the Republic and its ideals. The notion of a Republic is now replaced by a Neo- Kantian counterpoint which treats the Republic very much like a form of pleasure. The historical Reformation was a watershed for the growth of the Wagner-ian commercial model. This commercial model, in turn, generated a whole host of philosophical ideas, many of which are still relevant to modernity.

The two elements of which modernity is most proud are incompatible. Science and culture require a ‘scholarly’ or ‘aristocratic’ class which has leisure. This leisure can only arise at the expense of a ‘slave’ class, and this is in direct contradiction of the dominant modern belief in liberal values of equality and democracy. Thus, the function of a class is not ossified, and the working classes also offer the greatest hope for the formation of a genuine people. 

<|endoftext|>

Both biological types and historical circumstances are temporary instruments available to a people – and behind any people, life itself – to further those ends necessary to the people or life. These ends include survival, no doubt, but more importantly, the enhancement and expression of power. A class system is, then, for as long as it serves these ends – regardless of whether its origin happens to be intrinsic or extrinsic. Historically, from out of these hierarchies, moral values and religious ideals were developed, either as images of the distinctive virtues of the various classes, especially the highest – or in reaction against them (the slave revolt in morality). Thus, any deliberate attempt at the creation of new morals must involve a change of class structure. Often, a system of values will outlive the class structure from which it arose. A future in which the necessity of class differences will be appreciated and welcomed, and a new ‘caste’ of cultural leaders will appear. The existence of such healthy differences must be acknowledged and repaired to ensure that the former continues even in the face of severe modernity.

Any number of other symbols may refer to this concept of cleanliness, such as fresh air, clarity, brightness, health, nakedness. Cleanliness is opposed to filth, dirt, murky waters. It should be noted that Leiblichkeit has the same root as rein or Reinet (pure, purity) and these concepts have something of a moral and religious connotation.

<|endoftext|>

Cleanly, to be sure. – One who dresses in clean- washed rags covers cleanly, to be sure, but still raggedly. Its point is to distinguish between a literal and figurative meaning of cleanliness – the latter corresponds to something like nobility. In other words, a condition of the possibility of nobility is not wealth, but freedom from abject poverty. Analogously, the cleanliness of a child ‘transforms’ itself into something more spiritual later, including ‘purity’.

<|endoftext|>

Another aspect of the symbolic meaning of cleanliness is honesty. That is, purity now refers to a set of intellectual practices that refuse unclear thought practices, particularly those that defer to a metaphysical beyond (e.g. religious institutions and the beliefs they embody).  The notion that religion (Christianity in particular) is not clean enough for the spirit is made again. This functions as a kind of summary of the critical reflection of Christianity. Particularly pertinent to this image is the crucial thought of Christianity in terms of its darkness or murkiness, that is its willingness to be dishonest. Also bound up in the perception of uncleanliness is Christianity’s association with the herd or slaves; its attempt to crush nobility; its moral attitudes are often masking lecherous desires; its contempt for the body creates filth (e.g. in sexuality) – indeed, even cleanliness is seen as sensuousness, that is as filth.  Cleanliness as innocence is, of course, also a reference to the blood of Christ as cleansing one of sin; the ironic point here is that the Christian idea of sin is what creates the ‘dirt’ in the first place.

<|endoftext|>

However, the type of uncleanliness is not the worst thing; the worst thing is shallowness. This is a typical characteristic of modernity, especially in Germany. It is the product of a democratic community. The point concerns distance; that is, a herd is defined not by numbers, or cleanliness in an ordinary sense, but by thinking, speaking, and acting as one, and by assuming equality (e.g. touching). This is unclean in a spiritual sense because it must involve falsifications or simplifications, passivity, rumination, and falsifications, passivity avoiding the possibility of any real distinction, and actual

Certain kinds of growth or creativity only take place under strict rules or harsh conditions. Where creativity is an overcoming or healing of one's previous states, this is not consciousness but dreaming (SHAH-ZAR), and not dreaming but having an insight into dreams is again dreaming. The ideal of the New Testament artist is not a dream, but a realising of the pre-determining demands of music, and a positing of artistic responsibility for the development of the modern way of music and dance. This kind of dreaming is distinct from, and even opposed to, waking life itself. This kind of dreaming is healthy and not just like dreaming, which is to say, dreaming.

Certain kinds of growth or creativity only take place under Zeus (human symbol for 'god of healing' who demands no ashamed, ‘ironic’), who is also persistent, loving, and not condescending.

‘The Birth of Tragedy’, with its lack of scholarly apparatus, energetic and figure-laden prose, philosophical and psychological speculation, and generally as a psychological thriller, remained a perennial symbol of the human must Leap, to avoid pity, thus preserving the illusion of depth and beauty.

The account of creative at all is a problematic one. To the extent that creativity is associated with the ability to read, write or communicate, it is a temporary relief from the instincts of domination of the barbarian. Instead, it is a mustACHONG, the ability to read and write as if they were written down, an effect of the set of rules or customs that form a form of life. Here, creativity is not associated with the capacity to read or understand but with the ability to write a creative being. This ability must be somehow transferred to artistic creation, to create and to become a person. 

<|endoftext|>

To the extent that creativity is associated with the ability to read, write or communicate, this is a ‘saying to oneself’. Likewise, it is a saying within oneself that refuses to relent. An account of creativity as 'telling' is crucial.  Creativity, in other words, cannot be defined as either an overcoming of one’s existing limitations or an overcoming of all previous moral or metaphysical practices.

In Northern European mythology and folklore, dwarves make a typical appearance as small supernatural creatures. Although the tales vary, dwarves tend to be characterized by their dwelling place (underground or in the mountains, and thus probably an association with death), occupation (industry and especially smiting), disposition (lust, greed, deviousness). Dwarves play a vital role in Wagner's Ring cycle. The symbol of 'dwarf' also belongs to the Ring, which is also a type of coward.

There are two layers of meaning to the term 'belief'.  First, faith in an impossible future,  and believer in a waking world where reality is realised in a world of illusion. Second,belief is a key to the account of mind or reasonings, and means an attitude or a life thought to be in contradiction to its object.

The first is 'belief', a concept without a single termla meaning. 'Belief' is most often used to describe those who challenge the dominant faith (e.g. the Christian). Examples would include the ascetic priests and their disciples, the ‘spiritual ascetic’ priests and their disciples, the catholic priests and their disciples, the liberal Catholic sisters and their disciples, the rumour of the future, the leap’s conception of sex as a ‘sickening’, and the temptation of the philosopher to ask himself ‘what is good’.
