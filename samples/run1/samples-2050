 not to mention the many, many, many subtle manipulations that it entails – including the creation of nature and the growth of human power.

Moreover, the historical investigation often shows that a given amount has its origin in its opposite, and thus remains a kind of self-determination. This is known as the ‘historical sense’. Finally, such historical analysis is valuable because it opens new possibilities for values. So, for example, the analysis of climate change is a ‘new twist’, even though this new twist is being performed with great care and attention. So, for example, the analysis of new possibilities is a ‘new cruelty’, and certainly not a new kindness. Likewise, new values arise that conflict with or even destroy existing values. So, for example, the healing instinct is a ‘new will’, but it is a new cruelty to come to consciousness of values.

The devil has three primary meanings. First, it is common fears and traditional conceptions of evil. Second, the devil may be certain temptations, through which one might deviate from or be held down from one’s path of growth. Zarathustra’s devil is the ‘spirit of gravity’, while the sorcerers is ‘spirit of melancholy’ (gravity and indestructibility are both variations on the word ‘Schwarz’ which means ‘heavy’). Third, the devil indicates the interconnection of the good and the bad, the positive and negative (i.e. the notion that opposites are not opposite). Thus, the devil is just God’s leisure every seventh day.

However, the devil can also be the ‘spirit of a tight rope and a bait for the good’ – that is, the devil will chase after the grain and the big idea, the devil shall slay the beast’ – and the good shall cleanse itself of its effects. This is another example of the idea of the ‘need’ being able to impose oneself but not having to impose anything else. 

<|endoftext|>

However, the devil may not be the highest human being, but he is a tight rope and a bait for the good. This is another hint that the root of the concept of the ‘spirit of gravity’ is not in the ascetic ideal, but in the freedom of will to impose your will, and not to have your opinion rejected. The idea of gravity is also used in ‘On Truth and Lies’. The notion of gravity is on its own; science has accepted the theory of gravitation and its relationship to height. The laws of nature are discovered, recognised and affirmed as principles of life. Notable facts about gravity include its agon, agonizing, and going down; its delight, its delight at suffering; and its joy in the body. For example, gravity in laughter, or in dance, is both rhythmic and allegorical: the laughter is about the ascending and descending cycles of a body, which in turn is a dream; the agon is a body whose development is prevented by physiologies; the agon is a body whose agon is agonized; the agon is a body whose agonizes are agonizingly agonous; the agon is a body whose agonizes are an ‘accident’; the agon is a body whose agonizes are an ‘accident’ to life. Such an agon is generally acknowledged as one of the critical moments of the growth of the human, and one that the development of humanity must be prevented from suffering. The agon is thus a crucial analogy for internalization, the opinions of or relationships to others becoming part of one’s identity. The struggle is the expression of an unstoppable will to power, and a crucial moment of beauty and genius.

The struggle is either among those of equal power, or feminine or masculine. The masculine, that is, is primarily used to describe the externalization of those characteristics of masculine culture that are culturally symbolic of power and sexuality, and which are, in themselves, beautiful. The transformation of this symbolic culture into a human’s, and thus a human’s beauty, takes place through the ‘self-overcoming’ of Dionysus. The beautiful find themselves in the mode of things to do or to think, and not in the passivity of triviality. The ironic point here is that the ‘self-overcoming’ of Dionysus is a transformation of the realm of ordinary concerns’, to the realm of matter and substance. This self-overcoming is in contradiction to the Dionysian maxim. The form of this Dionysian is described by Zarathustra as turning into

 not merely reactive, but in all the senses of cheerfulness.

Happy because unconcerned with past or future, or not stricken by heavy thoughts (here, chewing the cud means focused in the present moment, not prone to nausea). The cow is also patient and seeing, and thus a metaphor for reading and interpretation as an art lost in modernity; rumination means to consider and contemplate without hurry. The cow is trusting, not slighted by distance or change; warm and reassuring like a faithful companion. The cow is an essential religious symbol in many Eastern religions: the ‘voluntary beggar’, learning contentment from a herd of cows, is a portrait of Jesus as a displaced and misunderstood Eastern sage. The cow’s calm is a possible and worthy response to nihilism and the degeneration of humanity.

Beauty is both a narrower and a more comprehensive concept: more restricted, because not all art has been beautiful as its aim or effect; more extensive, because not all that is met as beautiful is art. Beauty plays a role as the healing quality of the Apollonian illusion, which both protects us from but also allows some access to wisdom concerning the true nature of the world. This also means that the primary distinction among aesthetic categories is not between beauty and sublimity (Homeric epic is a relevant category within the Apollonian), but between both together and a third: the Dionysian effect that rightly belongs to music. Beauty is a late innovation, masking the shudder in the presence of the divine. 

<|endoftext|>

Beauty has a decisive relationship to knowledge. Nothing is beautiful, but only because it is known; likewise, the origin of beauty may be ugliness coming to an awareness of itself. Because knowledge always involves projection of human values onto its object, and could only be knowledge of being, it is thus an object of the contemplation of things. The portrayal of expertise, as far as it must involve a metaphysical error, is beautiful; and the progress of knowledge is the transformation of the ugly into the beautiful. Philosophical reflection in terms of procreation and childbirth: the philosopher is pregnant with wisdom and requires a beautiful soul (Socrates) as midwife to bring this wisdom to term. The lover does not pursue beauty per se but gives birth ‘in beauty’. Thus, for example, history must be ‘overcome’ and ‘bathed in beauty’ for genius to be born. Beauty urges one towards procreation (either sexually or spiritually). The influence of Plato also contributes to the consideration of thinking of beauty as feminine. This feminine beauty means protective, preserving, approximating to being (i.e. relatively unchanging). The feminine and masculine become moments in an account of creativity.

<|endoftext|>

Similarly, beauty arises under constraint or discipline. All these instances are further evolutions of the original idea of Apollonian beauty as healing, but also as allegory a form of indirect wisdom. For further discussion, see the entry under feminine. However, the beautiful can also be ‘wild’ (e.g. the ‘beast-of-prey beauty’ of the sea; the beauty of wickedness; or noble passion). This reiterates the lack of a profound contrast to the sublime as conventionally thought, the fact the calmness of protective beauty is a symbol and not a straight-forward property so that beauty is only part of a concept of life, which also involves creation and destruction. Thus, for example, ‘struggle and inequality are present even in beauty’.

<|endoftext|>

Beauty is a quality of the ideal (e.g. the gods) that a human value sets for itself; thus, beauty is a human measure, ‘given’ to the world, by means of which it affirms or even worships itself. Thus, the metaphor of everything being a mirror to one’s beauty. The spectacle of ascending life is beautiful; degeneration is ugliness. As again in Plato, an attraction in itself is not the goal or endpoint, but either ways or means – that is, its own view of the way the real is supposed to be. In practical observation, however, it is still little changed. For example, the reflection of pimples in the mirror is still a reflection of the reflection of blood; the different intensities of the psychological response to cold – see also the allusion to the eternal recurrence of the cold and suffering in 'the cold and suffering' – is again introduced. Again, though, every experience must lead to a cocoon of experiences, ‘where’s sickness is without ‘pathos’ (training).

Beauty is

 not and would never have arisen without the ‘creation of beings from nothing’. These concepts are not, however, in contradiction of each other. If one rigorously rejects the hypothesis of a world, heaven or hell, then ultimately one will have to create other things (e.g. the impostor or the slave).

In modernity, the concept of danger is itself the product of ‘modern ideas’. That is, the concept of modernity (in Europe, especially in Germany) involves carrying on despite severe intellectual and moral discipline. Moreover, these ideas are directly opposed to any conception of the historical development of culture or of the human. Thus, the concept of ‘danger’ is not derived from either science or culture, but from either. Also, the danger lies in overestimating the power of the will and overestimating the power of the specific, which is not underestimated.

Descartes is a seventeenth-century French philosopher. His famous speech at the ‘Convalescence’ of 1862, where he uses the metaphor of a broken promise to describe the state of the human. The text is lightly text-like, but with a strong intellectual character. The book falls into two parts. The first concerns are the association of philosophy, metaphysics, or history with the life of an individual. The other is the relation of philosophy to the life of the philosopher – and his or her opinions are thus under attack.

The primary condition of communication is the sharing of a language – a system of signs and significations. But what is signified is by no means either ‘raw’ (i.e. uninterpreted) experiences or things in the world; somewhat, these significations are changed by values. Therefore, having a language in common is dependent upon also sharing a set of values. It follows that communication of thoughts that depend upon a new set of values, or those values themselves, is the most difficult. Moreover, one’s values are a product of one’s constitution – for example, various inheritances from the past, including both cultural and genetic, the habits that form a mode of life, etc. So, to communicate genuinely new thoughts or values would be to transform the listener. There is the same problem with interpreting or understanding ancient cultures. Particularly to the ancient Greeks,  there is an aloneness that is difficult and perhaps impossible to bridge (‘Homer’s Contest’); alternatively, if it can be bridged, would result in a transformation of the present – this, for example, is the reason which gets repeatedly emphasised the Greek sense of religion.

This ‘pessimistic’ view of language is not the final word, however. That which is noble will have both a need and ability to speak both a ‘ pessimistic and also a positing’ sense. The pessimist, on the other hand, would claim knowledge of everything that is not yet determined and to say nothing of the things which are already certain. Greatness is defined not by the ability to speak only a modified version of a characteristic of a problem, but by the ability to problematize and even formulate new values. The type of the philosopher currently thought of as having these characteristics: the one who is ‘at home’ in the present and yet still seeks to challenge and even surpass his or her condition of existence.

426. The concept of mythic symbols represents the mechanism by which culture might be unified, and thus share a common fate, but which also has a responsibility for the development of the human. 42 The concept of Dionysian can also be thought of as a single eventful period in Greek culture – the advent of Christianity. This is romantic notions of the Dionysian as the overcoming of Christian ideals in the modern period. Thecoming together of Christianity and Greek culture is traced back to the as yet unfulfillable promise of the Dionysian. Dionysus thus becomes a key figure, a god who tempts or seduces humanity to growth and health. Theropod as a central character, and the Greeks as the breeding ground for the later  Mosaic model. The role of architecture in European history and culture is thus also an offshoot of the Apollonian conception of the city.

 433. Architecture is a system of ways of creating and preserving wealth or power; in other words, it is a form of life that is primarily for the sake of life and not because of some other intrinsic value. Architecture is thus one of the oldest expressions of the European concept of architecture, and one that is founded upon the hypothesis of a dynamic, dualistic European modernization’.
