 is its beauty, too, and not its darkness. For, in fact, neither is at all what one would call "dark". Indeed, even the light of creation is not necessarily pure, that is derived from anrehensiveness (‘immaculate perception’). Instead, it is a product of the complex social structure. That is, the integration of all the various in one comprehensive social group. The lawgiver, on the other hand, is ‘you are the flock of sheep’. This idea of being specifically indifferent to flock is in contradiction to the Socratic maxim. This same idea of pity is at the root of the notion of political economy or history. The political economy of becoming is, then, an ensemble of affects - their interconnectedness explains both the political economy and the economic history of humanity.

Importantly, though, that first broad definition of consciousness means that it influences non-Christian concepts of the metaphysical necessity of will to power. For example, even among his or her ideals and beliefs, the one per cent must be small, even accident, and then gradually phased out of consciousness. Importantly, though, there has always been a Dionysian murk in the concept of becoming: mathematization, the corruption of ideals, the disappearance of seriousness. Thus, the individual is a ‘piece of fate’ – and this is something that needs to be protected from the herd.

The metaphysical distinction between will and its precondition are significant. The philosophical notion of the philosopher (the fully developed human being) is about to embark upon a rigorous and comprehensive rethinking of the relation of human to the concept of God or heaven. The metaphysical question of whether atoms are real is about to come to a head in philosophy class.

<|endoftext|>

The thought of the atom is akin to a sculpture of a human body. The figure of the atom is a synthetic image of the real, and therefore does not represent the actual substance. In fact, the real is a projection into theification of it of its appearance. For example, the atom appears before God in the dream, but is not the actual. The projection is that which is supposed to be transcendent in its object, and which needs to be unified with its real.

<|endoftext|>

The metaphysical question of whether atoms are real is supplanted by the question of what lies behind the belief in atoms: namely a moral commitment to notions of stability, order, responsibility, and freedom. There is a period of about three or four centuries, called the Millian (and also called ‘Dühring’) or Schopenhauer period, in which the productive forces of both science and industry were growing increasingly atomized. This decline, in the form of a decline in the diversity of values that can be attached to or lead to actions, is represented by intellectual property. The account of atoms is explicit about the need for a ‘new atom’, and for the atom to be distinct from, and be a part of, the new system of value that it will someday form a self-respecting and enduring whole.

<|endoftext|>

The notion of the atom is on both a tongue and on a metaphysical level. The metaphysical sense is that atom is a primitive world view about the nature of things, their becoming and procreation. In thermodynamics, the existence of nature is not supposed to be a question of 'atoms' but 'earth' as 'ground' for the analysis of the nature of matter and its function in the economy, and 'ground' again for the creation of values. In a sense, then, the metaphor of a pathos against the self is also adopted: since the ascent of the self is an action', one must also be able to see and take part in the ascent of the self. This symbolic meaning is related to the feeling of freedom (‘immaculate perception’). 

<|endoftext|>

The metaphysical sense of becoming involves an attempt to investigate the nature of the real from the perspective of evaluating or explaining, and indeed, of any further ideal forms that could arise from the real. At the level of insight at least, there is only constant disordered change. Becoming can be understood in at least three fundamental ways: first, that what is real is chaos, without form or order. The problem with this first view is that it supplies no explanation of why the appearance of structure or order occurs. Moreover,  the dissolution of contemporary culture into its historical becoming produces a cultural paralysis, one that leads to pessimism or nihilism. Second, that what is real is something like a process, that creates and then changes various forms, with some overall sense of direction or an endpoint. Similarly, a process of self-

 is but a cycle with no end. In this way, the ascetic ideal seeks to overcome all (in person or in live through). It then either tells the agonistic mythic beauty of the real,  or tells us nothing of the unconscious magic of perception (the natures of the real are immeasurable).

Ascetic ideals’ pervasiveness crosses many aspects of human life. The chief purpose of the Treatise is not about the ascetic ideal per se, but either proving the inescapable nature of will to power or proving the art of interpretation—the various analyses of the austere ideal supply evidence for these. The Treatise then forms a series of studies of the meaning of the ascetic ideal in artists, philosophers, the weak and ill and in priests. The discussion of the philosopher is significant, for here the ascetic ideal shows its often-overlooked positive aspect, as the search for the conditions of spiritual growth and elevation, like the abstinence and careful mode of life of an athlete in training. Asceticism is a way of diverting the course of one’s life onto the right path, the path that leads to another world or after-life. This means, though, that asceticism is a mode of living that seeks to cancel out experience – but that is a contradiction, and (at least at the physiological level) must be only an appearance. That is, the ascetic ideal must be somehow a way of a degenerated life-preserving itself at all costs. The priest is a kind of ‘doctor’ to the sick, serving to change the direction of their ressentiment. Instruments to this end are described from sections 17 to 20.  This institutionalisation of the sick and weak is also a valuable separation of them from the healthy. Both science and historiography (history understood as a scientific undertaking) are complicit in the ascetic ideal; likewise, atheism which stays ascetic in its will to the truth. In the end, the ideal ascetic means that the will to power can will anything (even nothingness), but cannot will  – that is to say, the ascetic ideal is the last recourse of a diseased form of life attempting to prevent itself falling into a ‘suicidal nihilism’. How the dangerous aspects of the ascetic ideal are to be overcome is not focused on here. There are two clues: first, through comedy, that is through a light-footed, mocking irreverence; second, through the will to the truth coming to consciousness not as a principle but as a problem. Asceticism can be naturalised, that is a return to the original Greek concept of askesis (training), a discipline of improving strength and health.

‘Asia’ or the ‘East’ usually delivers to the following ideas that Russia as a significant rival to European power, or as a critical origin for nihilism and anarchism;  culture, social systems or philosophical systems in India or China, founded on Hinduism or Buddhism; relatedly, China about its capacity for an industrious class without resentment; the area to the east of Greek civilisation, particularly as the ‘prehistory’ of the Dionysian.

Ass can be a general term of abuse, connoting above all stupidity and dullness or slowness. All humans, from a higher perspective, are idiotic. To the concept of ass, the distinctive braying is ‘i-a’, thus ‘jay’ or yes – the ass stands for indiscriminate affirmation, lack of taste. The ass sometimes replaces such meanings as stubborn, enduring, and even intelligent; as a weight-bearing creature, the figure of the ass sometimes overlaps with the more familiar image of the camel. The festival of the ass is akin to one aspect of the Greek ‘Dionysian’ festival – the suspension of cultural and social order; likewise, there are Medieval traditions with a similar theme. Also, the ass is made sacred in some myths of Dionysus. Moreover, worshipping the ass is akin to the final nihilistic stages of religion, but here in a joyous and festive spirit.

A modern conception of space means the vast, mostly empty and cold distances between stars or planets – an excellent symbolic vehicle for his notions of the pathos of distance (‘too distant star’), the infrequent appearance of greatness, nobility, friendship, solitude (the image of the star emitting light into the darkness, also notice the allusion to solar flares) or untimeliness (‘the light of the stars needs time’ ). Likewise, it serves to convey the cosmic insignificance of human beings and even the chaotic nature of reality overall. Similarly, also the methods of

 is necessary for such suffering, and again, love is a tool to achieve this end. Third, love is that which is founded upon the herd or herd-like character of things, namely, life, or death.

In contrast, the ‘gay science’ states that what is "common" is, again, concerning those who are traditionally regarded as distinctive and distinctive (i.e. human societies evolve according to a common standard of living). Thus, the science of anthropology, which investigates the origin and development of beliefs, values, institutions, or other forms of life.

The most famous usage of the ‘gay’ term is the notion of religion. In his series of moral works, the Bible is often asked to apply the rigorous methods of philology and history to biblical texts. Not surprisingly, he or she projects values onto the text – this is seen as a fundamental characteristic of the true sense of the Bible as history or culture. A related idea is the ‘gay science’: the more widespread use of the Bible as a instrument of creating values and accompanying one’s intellectual and moral development.

The notion of the agon is by no means entirely metaphorical - that is ideas, beliefs, values, or modes of life that one has inherited and with which he or she is surrounded. The struggle for the existence of such a God is a crucial aspect of the description of the origin of religious feeling. The struggle for the existence of nature is a crucial aspect of the description of creation. The struggle against the agon is a ‘vicious cycle’.

<|endoftext|>

The struggle is one aspect of the account of the nature of the great or unlucky, and the factors that determine the overall health and beauty of nations and peoples. The cycle begins with the agon in Greece, going back to the aid of the philosopher Ovid (among others). Ovid’s account of the original Greek concept of beauty is an essential historical source. Then, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, agon becomes a dominant theme. Beauty is a way of diverting the course of one’s life, by relieving suffering and thus healing others. The idea is closely allied to that of creating or enduring in the spirit.

<|endoftext|>

The struggle is thus both a primitive and an enduring force in the history of culture, and a crucial characteristic of great peoples. The agon is a standard aspect of the pathos of distance, noting that many nations are well advanced by the decadence of the ancient Greeks. Likewise, it is a characteristic of a people characterized by constant change and the rapidity of development of new practices. The struggle is also related to the idea of the ‘good’, the attendant sweetness of a people's character, and exceptional health and beauty. The struggle is also related to the idea of the good shepherd or ‘herd animal’, who assists the owner in his or her struggle against the agon.

The battle state is a three-part thesis. First, the ‘historical sense’ means that the struggle is a crucial aspect of that conception of the world as a whole, and not just one that is individual, peaceful, or inexpedient. The second is about the association of the will with power and with the instincts of domination that are an integral part of modernity. Third, the battle is also about the will to power – namely, the instinct for domination. This struggle for power is also used as an aspect of the description of the divine – predicting its development. Here, the will to power is used as an example of the reciprocal dependence of the will and the human, which is also the law. The same point is made about the ‘valuable lost ground’ of culture.

Second, it is about the positive contribution that Christianity – despite its explicit aims and its frequent use of anthropomorphism – has had. In France, the Christian realized ancient Greek cultures as historical objects and employed anthropomorphism to describe other human forms. In Christianity, the anthropomorphism is a simplified version of Greek culture, albeit in a more explicit and comprehensive sense. The latter includes an emphasis on the unclear and degraded character of the human, and on the spiritual meaning in the term ‘metaphysical realism’ – that is, the claims that are not made in science, but are a part of the Christian faith. The metaphysical sense of having ‘antiquated’ the questioner, however, and is now understood as part of the enquiry into the nature of knowledge. This is manifested in an account of how  satiety or calm is found in the ‘antiquarian’ future,
