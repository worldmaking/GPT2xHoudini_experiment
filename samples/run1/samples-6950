 ‘one who can stand and still feel the source of strength". Second, to feel the source of strength is to apply the Lacanian (and elsewhere Asian) concepts of logic and logicès to values, and to apply the concepts of guilt and punishment likewise. Third, to apply the concepts of guilt and punishment also to values. This idea of justice is in contradiction to the Socratic maxim. The concept of punishment also comes into conflict with the Treatise on the Gotha (interpreted as a general Welfare state). Here, the actual is contrasted to the ‘vast’ margins of the social contract. And, again, the actual means what they are supposed to be: values.

‘The Birth of Tragedy’, with its lack of scholarly apparatus, energetic and figure-laden prose, philosophical and psychological speculation, and a mixture of ancient and modern contexts, was not what the philological community expected. It has three primary purposes and correspondingly divides into three sections. First, to elaborate a theory of ancient Greek tragedy as a synthesis of two metaphysically understood cultural drives (Apollonian and Dionysian). In this way, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ solves the relationship between cheerfulness and pessimism ingeniously - how could the Greeks, with their in-depth knowledge of suffering and futility, have remained cheerful? Second, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ traces the reasons for the decline of tragedy to a third drive, the Socratic, which is also the advent of science and modernity. Third, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ seeks to understand what it would mean, and what it would take, for tragedy to be reborn in the present. The account of culture is thus revealed to be a general one, and not specific to Greece. The book is heavily influenced (although not entirely uncritically) by Schopenhauer, and especially in its third part plays homage to Wagner.

Otto von Bismarck was the leading political figure in Germany from the 1860s to 1890. Bismarck provoked wars that in turn led to the unification of Germany around Prussian leadership. His brand of pragmatic and power politics, and his nationalism, made him as a symbol of all that was wrong with modern Germany.

Blood is a metaphor of life and a key symbol in Christianity for a life made eternal by being cleansed of sin. Notably, blood stands for the specific mode of life of an individual or group; thus, history transformed into blood: morals part of our ‘flesh and blood’. Blood is accumulated and passed down, forming peoples, types, or families (Geblüt means belonging to an aristocratic family line). Blood is that which makes one strong and capable of creating so that we have the vampire or leech images; also, the life-draining of specific ideas or practices, revenge, or asceticism or nihilism. Blood is precious; therefore, the mention thereof aphorisms and of things written in blood being an effort to read. Blood is also courage and the love of danger so that which is written in blood will take risks and those who read it to take risks with themselves.  Blood means sacrifice or martyrdom, which the idea is related to Christian symbolism, but also to Bismarck’s famous speech in 1862, where he uses the phrase ‘iron and blood’ to describe a nationalistic foreign policy not afraid to risk warfare.

Body means the human body as opposed to just any material object. If one rejects dualism – an account of the mind or soul as fundamentally different from, even separable from, the body – then bodily states are sensations, appetites, passions and so on, and thought and reason. In turn, this means that the one set of processes (those traditionally associated with a body) and the other (those usually associated with a mind) will require a similar set of explanatory accounts—this joint descriptive account in a materialistic account of physiology. The will to power seems to provide such an account that does not involve the metaphysical commitments of materialism. Moreover, these two sets must also influence each other (indeed overlap or coincide) much more than is thought. Importantly, the individual body is not necessarily the primary object of enquiry – groups based on gender, class, or race are treated as effectively one body. That is, certain groups are effectively a single organism. For example, the mobility and intermarriage of various human types vertically across classes, and geographically across Europe and beyond, has created mixed physiologies and thus also new types of cultural forces or possibilities.

Cialdini’s sound figure by Ernst Chaldini is a scientific demonstration of using the patterns formed by sand on a vibrating plate to visualize resonance. This is as representing a translation from vibration to image, but metaphorically an interpretation that is in no way obvious. and thus, does not allow us quickly to reverse the conversion back to the vibration.

The notion of chance is not, as one might have expected, primarily in the context of a discussion of physics or metaphysics. In these contexts, the much more common and destructive concept of chance is ‘critical reflection’. The key to such reflection is the ‘critical number’, which is assigned to effects based upon their type. A class is, in effect, a specific set of drives or beliefs that give rise to specific practices or results. The cave, therefore, is not only a restricted space to talk about classes, but also about the philosophical community as a whole.

The allusion to the disciples of Jesus is unavoidable, and therefore it is not productive. So, for example, the ‘critic in the cave’ talks about those who refuse to take risks and cannot be ‘reactionary’ against their fate. The cave, rather than being a dark place of uncertainty, is depth (in the sense of abyss) but is also elevated in the mountains. Likewise, the cave is the depths of insight’, and the abyss is depth. Finally, the philosopher-hermit does not ever have ‘ultimate and real opinions’, and thus does not understand the human or even the cave.

CHAOS is a Semitic term meaning ‘without a future’. It was used by the Hermetic sect of Schopenhauer to characterize critical reflection. The group consists of those who are aware of and feel the ‘gathering gloom of the religious-moral pathos’ but also say that the time for reflection has passed. The meaning of the ‘gathering gloom’ in German is thought to be the reason for the absence of artists, writers, or mathematicians in the modern sense. Writing is, therefore, a necessity, like a ‘heavy burden’ that is somehow somehow to be lifted. The philosopher-hermit does not ever have ‘ultimate and real opinions’, and thus does not understand the human.

CHAOS IS AGE

The meaning of the term obsession is discussed initially. The key to the concept of obsession is the notion of age. It is the work of German anthropologist and philosopher, Dieter Hilborn, who posit age as the period of greatest suffering and greatest creativity (in Europe and the actual, this is called ‘ich et innen’ ).ism and 422 million years as the period of greatest genius and greatest exhaustion.  It is the period of the decay of the human organism, which is defined not by the rate of change, but by what is in some sense a moral value.ism – that is to say, the individual is responsible for the fate of the collective organism;  for  Hobbesism the individual is the pinnacle of humanity, and the individual thinker the lowest common individual.

The other primary philosophical drive is the notion of the will to power. The relevant sense of the philosopher is considered as the overcoming of the rule of law by the will. This concern associates the conception of the philosopher (and the very next element in the chain of thought that is metaphysics) with the conception of the overcoming of logic. The coming together of Christianity and Judaism into a singular cultural production is, in part, an overcoming, of the two dominant moral systems in Europe and the unification of the human. This desire for the reformation of the church is another relevant use of the term.

On the aspect of religious and theological meaning, then, to 'discern' or ‘discern’ the idea of creating a new way of life by ‘creating from out of oneself'. Such an idea of creating from the past or future involves a denigration of the existing forms of life, and alihood of the formation of a modern people. Second,  to some extent, this creation is associated with the enhancement or creation of power. The first is the notion of power. That is, a modern people is defined not by numbers, but by the will to power – and this creates a danger of the formation of a people. The second relates to the notion of ‘infertile’ women. A third relates to the ‘voluntary manslaughter’ of a pregnancy, which is often the product of over-abundance and over-pessimism.

The word ‘corruption’ is the same as that which is translated ‘corruption’ in German: the corruption of culture, the dissimulation of the spirit, the decline of the good and great, and the general appearance of health and beauty in the history of science and philosophy. Corruption is a term applied to the ‘pathos of distance’, the corruption of the will into the ‘kindness of life’ and the corruption of the human. It is a strong point of the origin of the concept of corruption, as well as its connection to the notion of eternal recurrence. Also, the concept of corruption is used to characterize the ‘modern’ corruption of a genuine culture, to borrow a line from Plato: the effort is not just a ‘declaration of superiority’, but a ‘strong point of view’. Likewise, the corruption of sense values can be a ‘cunning’ way of thinking about things.

Contempt act as a feeling of power. To have contempt for something – that is, for one’s negative value judgement to achieve the level of a passion – is a mode of feeling power-over. It is, therefore, a primary drive. Likewise, the modern feeling that freedom is an absence of discipline. Equally importantly, the sense of power is a vital part of pity. Alternatively, self-contempt is found in empathy, as far as one projects one’s suffering onto others.

The devil has three primary meanings. First, it iscommonly understood as a strong-willed and determined individual who seeks to dominate the situation. Second, the devil may be certain temptations, through which one might deviate from or be held down from one’s path of growth. Zarathustra’s devil is the ‘spirit of gravity’, while the sorcerers is ‘spirit of melancholy’ (gravity and melancholy are both variations on the word ‘Schwarz’ which means ‘heavy’). Third, the devil indicates the interconnection of the good and the bad, the positive and negative (i.e. the notion that opposites are not opposite). Thus, the devil is just God’s leisure every seventh day.

Although in modernity, the androsy are not separable, there is a significant difference: the more 'comfortable' or 'profound' a language is, the more difficult it is for words to be transformed into sounds or forms; the more difficult is the conversion from a rare and ‘lies’ to a general language used throughout history. This easygoing nature can bearers of images of wisdom and greatness, as well as ‘hatred’ among noble or religious persons. The effect of cheerfulness is to transform the considerate, such that it becomes a crucial characteristic of a despising culture (see despising the lamb). Thus, the effect of
