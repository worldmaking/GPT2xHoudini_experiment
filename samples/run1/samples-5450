 Only the will can will affairs within themselves; moreover, the straight-forward nature of those acts of benevolence that are counted as 'good'. That is, benevolence is a necessity, not a reward. 'Animal defers to God, but does not belong to man. Therefore, the concept of being on the straight of 'no' is an example of 'you'. Likewise, benevolence is a virtue associated with clear thinking and restraint, with the ruthlessness often attached to unclear thinking and sentimentality. Also, benevolence must be founded on a benevolent inclination towards the self  – this anticipates two critical aspects of the notion of benevolence. First, the idea of a willed achievement, one that would allow the system of power to be revalued, which would allow individual strength to overcome; second, the idea of a ‘gathering of spirits’ to take on the task of redemption. Third, these spirits will to power produce a pure God. This notion of a Godot is, of course, beside the point concerning the ‘semi-official religions’: atheism is to be judged by the opposite faith. Second, there are several incomplete attempts from the mid-1880s on to produce a metaphysical argument that relates the concept of being to the concept of substance. Analogously,  what is being is the product of many incompatible beliefs. Moreover,  this argument treats appearances, including being, objectively so. Analogously,  it is the opposite of the belief in the existence of nature; thus,  it is a pessimist's reaction against the ‘love of the neighbour’.

A dog is a domesticated, and degraded, beast of prey. Thus, it is both suddenly aggressive, and contemptible in its display of cowardliness, distress, or anger. Having been a slave, it has become nothing other than a slave. Thus, the dog is a crucial analogy for internalization, the opinions of or relationships to others becoming part of one’s identity. The dog’s famous loyalty is nothing more than submission, and it is thus no more capable of love, but for a different reason, than the cat. This submission is akin to a human’s religious feeling – obedience out of fear, or long discipline. The dog is something that is supposed to be wretched so that its owner can feel important or influential. The sheepdog is an obvious metaphor for those who devote themselves to the protection of the herd. The firedog is noisy, spectacular, but irrelevant – and thus like the socialist revolution and similar events. The critical moments are quiet, creative of values. Zarathustra tells the story of a traveller accidentally stepping on a sleeping dog, making enemies of those who could be friends.

The term dream is used to characterize the Apollonian. The critical distinction here is not between dreaming and being awake; the dream is employed to understand a certain domain of culture, and particularly of art. The dream is a self-created world, one that is created to be aligned with our instincts of preservation and our need to justify our existence and our values. The dream is not merely an illusion – we can be aware of ourselves dreaming – but the validity of the beautiful forms that we dream are derived from their role in our health and our preservation, and not in their truth-speaking. In a general psychological theory of the dream, dreams are the way to make sense of stimuli through a retrospective ascription of causation. But this precisely is how we live our waking lives also. The analysis changes focus, to dreams as the space in which our drives act or realize themselves; again, this is like the dream of figuring out which pathos is right for the right to stand for the sake of, and which is a form of growth.

Moreover, not only is waking life not a great deal different from dreams but that, to the extent that we insist on it being so, this is a sign of weakness or degeneracy. Waking life is the domain in which our instincts or drives are despised, but the values expressed, and developed, in my dreams will inevitably find their way into waking life. Likewise, the degeneration of the will means that we moderns do not understand the 'freedom of the will' even in our dreams. Also, 'ancient humanity' continues in oneself, in both waking lives and a dream. So, 'what is "appearance" to me now? Indeed, not the opposite of some essence' – that is, appearance, even dream appearance, is again not contrasted to some straight-forward relationship to that which is true. Instead, 'appearance is the acting and living itself' – adjectives without an 'x' that they are adjectives of. 'Dream' thus becomes an essential element within the analysis of the 'true world' (Microbe

 Only the concepts of myth and culture should be understood as tools for the purposes of philosophy; likewise, the origin of virtue should be judged in terms of its relationship to power. Old Testament and New Testament instances of a Christian ministering to the sick are unavoidable allusions; the critical moments are quiet and virtue envy; the New Testament and Paul discuss the gift and its parallel in Paul; the relationship is parenthood in the body; and, the New Testament and Paul describe the unbeliever as a kind of ‘god’, who gives his or her all to make the world as beautiful as her ability to will, and continues to grow. Unbearable amounts also describe the agonising suffering that is the result of rejecting the life-giving values of the Christian faith.

The abandonment of the mythic innocence of Wagner by the Church is one of the critical events of the investigation of the effects of religion on modernity. Ariadne is a conventional figurehead for the revaluation of the Church, and thus also a representative of the broader culture as a whole. Wagner is characterised as a severe form of cultural fragmentation, waged against traditional art and culture as a whole. Ariadne, a common princess, is the symbol of a decadent culture that refuses to give up its innocence, and thus also what is often mistakenly thought decadence. The struggle for the innocence of Wagner is a crucial aspect of the analysis of the 'new barbarians'. First, the recognition of as a fundamental character of the modern state and a motivating factor behind many cultural forms; second, the creation of a new ‘prey’ to defend the innocence of that age against the rigours of modernity, and against the will of the noble class.

The love of one’s fate, specifically, a gratitude towards all that makes up the situation that I inhabit, and which has produced me in the way that I am. The root of the idea is found in the notion of ‘antiquarian history’. The interconnectedness of all things and events, this ‘all’ is effectively the whole course of history as far as that history ‘passes’, in part, through an individual. Amor fati is a ‘formula for greatness’. My love or gratitude comes from the fact that this fate produces me and does so as being capable of affirming myself and capable of having a creative role in the future.

The idea is closely allied to that of affirmation more generally:  to say yes is the only way of saying yes  to the things that are given up for the sake of becoming or progress. Here, the actual or genuinely so lives of themselves; their happiness is not an affirmation of self-preservation but of preservation and the growth of the human. It is related to the individual who has no future, only the certain self and/or individual distinction. N introduces his or her notions of gratitude or self-respect by saying that ‘Happy’ is a ‘complete and authentic culture’. It is a culture in which all the perspectives and perspectives ☆ are aligned. Here, the actual or genuinely so lives of the people are not separable but only perspectives within a cultural network. By saying yes to this whole system, I say yes to myself, too.  Amor fati is a culture where creativity is an overcoming of the system, a ‘future in which genius is the rule of life and death’.

The idea is closely related to that of affirmation which is something that people think is important but which is not. Affirmation is thus a setting of limits so that genius is often overlooked, but very much present in the nature of affirmation. Thus, for example, neither confirm nor contradict myself much more than is expected of an action of this nature. Affirmation is affirmed even within the framework of any philosophical system. The notion of critique becomes essential. Philosophical reflection becomes the only means of rethinking the responsibility of philosophy for the development of the concept of critique.

The idea is closely related to that of affirmation that there is a certain amount of pure essence that stays the same even in an eternal recurrence. This amount must be noble, not just a little something that is somehow not there. Thus, 'the gap' is an essential reference to the number of heavens and hundreds of moons. It is the origin of the term 'modern sanity' which is associated with education, with universalised access to health and happiness, a genuine criticism of the state but not of specific practices but of the ressentiment of 'profligate' and other forms of social discipline. Affirmation is tested when it becomes a virtue, a virtue so spectacular that it seems impossible otherworldly. The idea

However, opinions and beliefs are legitimated by the kind of person who holds them. There has differentiation between the opinions of ‘most people’ and those of ‘exceptional men.’ Those who live in the land of culture have no beliefs, but this is because they are ‘unworthy of belief’. But a people capable of creating must have a prophetic belief in their future.

Benevolence is an essential virtue, although not one well understood previously. The small acts of benevolence that people show to each other every day and counts the sum of little pleasures they evoke as, collectively, enormous. This effect arises even though benevolence is not unegoistic, and indeed founded upon a feeling of superiority. Pity is considered as a form of malice. Likewise, benevolence is a virtue associated with clear thinking and restraint, with the ruthlessness often attached to unclear thinking and sentimentality. Also, benevolence must be founded on a benevolent inclination towards the self  – this anticipates several key later ideas, such as the notion of a reactive will to power that is based on ressentiment, or the idea that the noble has self-veneration. Specific moral affects in terms of will to power are well advanced. Benevolence is traced back to the enhancement of power. After this point, benevolence drops out of view, to be replaced by other notions of virtue, notably veneration and magnanimity.

'Beyond Good and Evil' is notable for a more explicit discussion than is found outside his notebooks of the metaphysics that underlies N's reflections on morality and religion (e.g. the concept of the will to power). There are also nicely focused chapters on faith and virtue. The book ends with an essential evocation of the figure of Dionysus.

The Old Testament is one of the greatest, certainly the most sublime, pieces of literature, and the record of a great people. The New Testament a distasteful account of a catastrophic turn in European history. Luther's translation of the Bible into German is one of the critical events of the reformation and had a substantial formative effect upon the history of German. 'Beyond Good and Evil' is full of references to biblical events and persons, either for direct discussion or metaphorically (i.e. the images of love, gift and sacrifice are allusions to the life of Christ).

The bird is a symbol of rapid ascent, of something that needs and desires to be ahead of its time, to show spiritual growth. Birds must also be light, able to throw off burdens. The bird is thus in opposition to the spirit of heaviness. The flock of doves is precisely chosen because it is a conventional symbol of gentleness and peace but combined with the bird’s lightness and need for the ascent, and this is unlike a herd of sheep or cows, say. The dove image also has significant biblical echoes.

The eagle (Adler) is the most common bird mentioned in N. The most famous use of the eagle is the symbol of a healthy and honest pride. The eagle can view things as beneath it; this is both a specific comprehensive sight which is not an abstraction and honest pride. The snake is cleverness. The combination of these animals (the eagle carrying the snake) is something rare: those who have pride do not understand themselves; those who are clever tend to be self-loathing. It seems likely that they also represent two significant mythic and cultural inputs into Europe, the eagle as the masculine Greek, the serpent as the feminine Judaic, and the lamb as the feminine Judaic. The eagle is a bird of prey. Birds and especially the eagle, thus also stand for a kind of strength. Its happiness lies in relishing the terror of the great heights and the abyss, rather than in ignorance of that terror. Moreover, the eagle’s hunt is direct, straight down; it is thus, considered on its own, a noble ‘stupidity’. It is nourished on innocence, it both loves and hates the lamb – thus mirroring the relationship to the human, which is loved because of its yet unspoiled possibilities.  It is also led energetically by its types, those who are both physiologically incapable of joy and, importantly, have no creative or creative' significance.
