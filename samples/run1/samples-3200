irmation – the historical revaluation of knowledge is a crucial aspect of the account of ancient and medieval ignorance. Also, modernity and democracy produce a herd of herd-like features, characterized by talent for accumulating and retaining power, and blind obedience. This revaluation of power leads to the notion of reforms, including the creation of a new standard of living. Not all human beings are such herd-like features, however. Some are precisely those who are mischievous or wilful – and this does not mean that their exercise of the science of philosophy will be random and confined just because some endpires to some future.

‘The Birth of Tragedy’, with its lack of scholarly apparatus, energetic and figure-laden prose, philosophical and psychological speculation, and a mixture of ancient and modern contexts, was not what the philological community expected. It has three primary purposes and correspondingly divides into three sections. First, to give an account of the development of tragedy as a science;, primarily, this is to try to determine the primary philosophical concepts through which tragedy is read. Second, to investigate the possibility of revaluation of tragedy to science, in light of the success of the storyteller Sophocles; likewise, to investigate the possibility of new forms of cultural expression. Third, it is to discover what is chance and what is chance not studied, and to the extent that knowledge is a total accident, so that which is chance is mostly unconscious. The development of tragedy into the critical sphere is traced back to the necessity of discipline, and its overcoming, in the course of history. Here, the historical sense is broadly applicable, though with a view to revaluation in the future.

The second is the notion of fate known as the ‘five senses of fate’. The history of art and philosophy begins with the abstraction of, and the cultivation of anomie’, and this in itself is not tragic: rather, we are to imagine that this world or our being is somehow somehow somehow innocent and healthy. This is to imagine the vocation of the philosopher – and, in particular, the ideal of a new form of life that does not suffer from the defining features of modernity. The idea of innocence in art is an entire other discussion.

The third concerns are the notion of fate in relation to the real, and to the metaphysical commitments that underlie such discussions. The metaphysical commitments are: existence is a test of the will to power, of the will to power, of the abilities of an individual to overcome or avoid suffering, and of the ability of an individual to live with the past or future. In general, the account of fate is based on the idea of perseverance, or the life-or-death question of what is chance and how it is to be different from, and even inhibitory, the human feeling of happiness. Or, perseverance is responsible for the stability of cultures and the natural world. Or, it can be responsible for the formation of a people and a world. The two elements of which I am most in contradiction are the will and the creature. Both are necessary and proper in themselves; likewise, they are both a condition of life and a form of growth. Both are also necessary and appropriate for the growth of the human. However, as far as both are dynamic and influential, neither is. Nor is it a question of choosing to remain as if their creation would be a question of nihilism or destruction. In that way, fate is a constant flow of values, bringing to mind ancient Greek tragedy or Christian practical morality. Likewise, such a moral dispersion is possible because of the action of fate – that is, the fate of the philosopher – and is also akin to the overcoming of faith. This same moral dispersion, carries with it a moral responsibility of the highest kind.

Similarly, the course of eventsful will will to power will become predictable and subject to whatever is ahead of itself. Such predictableness, though, means that any cruelty will be naturalised and confined to the realm of becoming, and not continue in the pathos of becoming. This naturalisation means, though, that any cruelty judged against will be guilty of the greatest sin: namely, the creation of the worst. This is a saying about those who cannot tolerate cruelty and those who can but must be washed away.

Zarathustra has the same root as Plato, but it is different. First, Zarathustra as Moeller is differently named. Second, the idea of 'creation' is associated with Wagner, which is a minor innovation of German philosophy. Third, creation as Zarathustra is by no means entirely clear. Is Zarathustra merely reiteration of a already-deified idea that

irmation of the instincts of domination of the barbarian. These values, in turn, branched out into other sections of the barbarian. Among other things, the noble has to embody certain biologically impossible modes of life, and likewise certain agonisingly ancient practices that seek to correct this situation. The sovereign can produce noetic or nihilism, merely by recognising the instincts of domination.

"Beyond Good and Evil" is notable for a more explicit discussion than is found outside his notebooks of the metaphysics that underlies N's reflections on morality and religion (e.g. the concept of the will to power). There are also nicely focused chapters on faith and virtue. The book ends with an essential evocation of the figure of Dionysus.

The Old Testament is one of the greatest, certainly the most sublime, pieces of literature, and the record of a great people. The New Testament a distasteful account of a catastrophic turn in European history. Luther's translation of the Bible into German is one of the critical events of the reformation and had a substantial formative effect upon the history of German. 'Beyond Good and Evil' is full of references to biblical events and persons, either for direct discussion or metaphorically (i.e. the images of love, gift and sacrifice are allusions to the life of Christ).

The bird is a symbol of rapid ascent, of something that needs and desires to be ahead of its time, to show spiritual growth. Birds must also be light, able to throw off burdens. The bird is thus in opposition to the spirit of heaviness. The flock of doves is precisely chosen because it is a conventional symbol of gentleness and peace but combined with the bird’s lightness and need for the ascent, and this is unlike a herd of sheep or cows, say. The dove image also has significant biblical echoes.

The eagle (Adler) is the most common bird mentioned in N. The most famous use of the eagle is the symbol of a healthy and honest pride. The eagle can view things as beneath it; this is both a specific comprehensive sight which is not an abstraction and honest pride. The snake is cleverness. The combination of these animals (the eagle carrying the snake) is something rare: those who have pride do not understand themselves; those who are clever tend to be self-loathing. It seems likely that they are both derived from the image of a serpent, though the eagle is also the figure of someone who is supposed to be dancing in a hallucination. The snake is cleverness. The combination of these animals (the snake) is something that is both a specific and careful distinction, one that might allow someone like them to show their human form more genuinely, and one that might allow their animal form to show the human it is supposed to be dancing in. This cleverness could be because, in the above sense, the snake is already a snake: it is also a type of streak of lightning. The lightning never goes out of style, never even goes out of the realm of chance. Instead, the eagle and its association with the figure of Dionysus, it is the opposite of that which is supposed to be disciplined, continuous, and without resets. Thus, the snake is supposed to be able to see the light of reason. Indeed, the eagle is already considered as having the strength to stare at nothing but the light of day. Its happiness lies in relishing the terror of the great heights and the abyss, rather than in ignorance of that terror.

The eagle is the most common bird mentioned in N. The most famous use of the eagle is the symbol of a healthy and honest pride. The eagle can view things as beneath it; this is both a specific comprehensive view which is not an abstraction and honest pride. The snake is cleverness. The combination of these animals (the snake) makes people believe that they are indeed the features of a stable and honest pride. The eagle can view things as representing excellent friends and enemies, rather than merely their place of employment and ascent. It is in this way, it seems to be at the mercy of ‘‘’s pride and that is a crucial characteristic of a healthy pride. It is thus a ‘sickness’, a sickness which, in turn, is a characteristic of those who have been enslaved (the ‘slave revolt’).

The struggle is either among those of equal power, or unequal. The former may yield enhancement (for both parties). One reason struggle may not be productive is that it is not among equals: to war against an inferior is ignoble or shameful, to war against a superior is irreverent. Agon is productive, then, only if it recognises differences, rather than collapses them.

Thus, the concept of the agon is also part of 'modern ideas' such as equality, democracy or socialism. Similarly, tyranny is a monopoly of power that collapses power towards an individual—the struggle among agents within a social group. Struggle is also internal; however: since the individual self is formed of a multiplicity of drives, an agonistic 'society' is also found within the self. Thus, for example, the ascetic struggles to repress specific drives, or against enervation.

'The Great' King of Macedonia and famously conqueror of the known world from Greece east to India by the age of 32. Alexander gave Greek culture throughout the ancient world and brought Eastern culture West. When, 'Alexandrian' culture is a reference to wide dissemination, but also the attendant, Socratic turn of cultural scholarship to the mere accumulation of information (symbolised by the library at Alexandria). Thus, what are needed now are a series of 'anti-Alexanders' who concentrate and purify. Alexander is already a caricature of early Greek civilisation, exaggerated and simplified, although still displaying their deep-rooted cruelty ('Homer’s Contest’). The story of Alexander cutting the Gordian knot is a commonly used image.

An allegory is an image (visual or described in language) that has a certain coherence on its terms (is, for example, a recognisable thing, a character, a narrative) but also carries a symbolic meaning. This is conventional for a few added examples. Allegory can be termed ‘ironic’ when the allegorical vehicle already has a symbolic meaning of its own, but something else is meant. An example would be the use of the image of the heavens. The heavens become a symbol of the absence of providence.

Philosophical thinking about the nature of allegory begins early. While music is understood to be directly symbolic of the original unity of things, lyric poetry employs allegories to try the same symbolic work.  The same point is made concerning the allegorical nature of myth. The pure musical route, though, is untranslatable or incommunicable, and thus is not anything like an insight into or wisdom concerning the original unity. Thus, while Apollonian images are appearances – and thus,  it would seem something like the opposite of knowledge  – when they function as allegories, they are in fact an important mechanism of wisdom.

Even your best love is only a rapturous allegory. Here we have a factual situation (love or marriage) carrying symbolic meaning for those involved in that situation and for others. This is a case of a particular image (real marriage) that symbolises an idea but also serve as a set of practices or institutions that may inspire one to understand or pursue that ideal. In this case, the ideal is the role of masculine and feminine drives within the total health of both organism and culture. There is a similar use of the concept of allegory. In all these cases, human practices or institutions that may have utility on their terms, but which gain much of their significance from their allegorical meaning.

It is repeated that all permanence is a poet’s allegory, and the poets lie too much. All that is transient is merely allegory’. ‘Poet’ here does not only mean an artist in verse, but also anyone who posits permanence (the metaphysics of substance, or the theology of a god), since that is only a poetic device. Such lying allegories are not contrasted to any direct, non- poetic statement of facts. A model of language that values clarity, directness and the absence of imagery is even further from the capacity to speak the truths of, say, will to power. Instead, the contrast is with ‘higher’ allegories of time and becoming. Here, on every allegory, you ride to every truth. Similarly, only in dance can we tell the allegory of the highest things. Something like ‘inspiration’, then, is needed for such images to cease being a lie and reach to their proper symbolic functioning.
