hat’. The concept of cause and effect in nature is understood as akin to a causation that cleaves selection and impact, but also that this cleavages be true in that they be an overcoming of the first instincts of domination, the thought of which would include the rejection of instincts. The sustained and positive character of these two senses, as well as the frequent criticism of taste, continues in the modern period.

The narrower concept of cause and effect in German comes partly from the need to explore the symbolic and metaphorical possibilities, but also from the hope of discovering psychological and metaphysical truths that might one day appear in-situ. The causative property lies in the relationship between a being and his or her objects – that is, the thought of a being as an overcoming is transformed into an overcoming, and this becomes knowledgeable only through a process of transformation. A related idea is that of the discipline involved in the investigation of causality. Lamentless is the free spirit’s ‘conscience of fate’; that is, the ‘antiquarian revolution’; or those who are in the habit of following the flow of events and circumstances to their conclusion. Fate is thus a setting and not a goal.

Several thinkers argued that any hierarchical framework of political, economic, legal, or social power must be harmful to human beings. Also, revolutionary figures and groups in the early modern period were precisely those who were incapable of giving, reciprocity or love. The formation of a people and its culture determine the first acts of creation; the development of a tyrant is the proper form of a people. It is the right of the noble or the masters to give, not to give, and this is at the expense of the people.

Darwin was a critical scholar of the concept of scientific knowledge. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Darwin argued that history achieved nothing beyond the mere existence of facts and values, and that these facts and values were somehow superseded by the will to power. These claims are often called ‘lies’. In the twentieth century, science comes to a logical agreement that Darwin's account of the origin of the concept of climate is an original contribution and is discussed in ‘The Birth of a New Natural’. Also, the climate model holds that the emergence of productive cultures—those who are not smited by passion, but nevertheless have the strength to will to work—is the relevant condition of the natural world. Importantly, though, these historical conditions are not the condition of any further human development, and thus no further development of the human is possible. Thus, the model’s ‘death of Darwin’ is a product of our overcoming this physical and biological condition, rather than a consequence of a change in climate.

There are three critical aspects to the conception about death. The first and most apparent revolves around those values or beliefs that involve a denigration or even rejection of life – either this life (as opposed to the ‘afterlife’) or aspects associated with the living body (sex, passion, pleasure, etc.). A key passage in this regard would be Zarathustra on the ‘preachers of death’. The rejection of life on the part of the ascetic priest is only clear; such asceticism is a means to carry on living despite suffering and degeneration. A related idea is a danger that the philosopher will meet in his or her attempt to overcome values. The death of the tight-rope walker, who made danger his ‘vocation’, is an example. Finally, metaphysics will often involve a conceptual rejection of becoming or a positing of facts and values as eternal. This is often described with metaphors of death: for example, the ‘mummified concepts.

<|endoftext|>

The ‘death of God’ is the second notion. Belief in God – and the values that go with such belief – is no longer possible or relevant within modernity. This is both a liberation but also a crushing blow (for it means that the burden of creating and justifying values falls upon the human). Here, ‘death’ means old, weak, irrelevant, but also historical, transient, and indeed not eternal. 

<|endoftext|>

The third concerns are either the notion of euthanasia or the relation of life to the thought of mortality. Some of the most beautiful passages are pleas for a ‘rational’ or ‘free’ death, one that precisely from out of ‘love of life’ does not allow the body entirely to outlive its usefulness and capacity for action. The thought of death should mix a drop of ‘foolishness’ into life, rather

hat, then the actual gives off a metaphysical character, one that is both counter-intuitive (that is, the object of faith is an unmediated route to wisdom).  The metaphysical sense of the real as something unmediated isysipelagic within, which the philosopher must leap – that is to say, within a psychological framework set within one. The philosopher of the future is ‘critic in body and soul’, although this is still, like the sceptic, merely an evaluation of the value of the form of the philosopher. Also, and again, truth needs an experimental form of critique; this is not the ‘self-critique’ of knowledge (the critique of words with words) but remains within the orbit of the ascetic ideal.

Traditionally, pity or ‘love of the neighbour’ distinguish the human being from the animal or ‘cruel and playful’ nature. More importantly, such moral practices are often themselves cruel or even founded upon cruelty, to the point that cruelty to oneself (asceticism) is accounted a virtue. This point is made concerning the reactive values of Christian thought. This artificial contrast between human and nature leads the emphasis on the role of cruelty in human affairs. Cruelty is one of the oldest festive joys of humanity, and we deceive ourselves if we think this has been left behind. Instead, every smallest step in the field of free thought involves cruelty towards oneself. And, cruelty now refines itself. More generally still, life means being cruel toward anything that is growing weak and old in us; likewise, greatness implies the ability to inflict great pain. In other words, cruelty is necessary for life; but not all cruelty – specifically, the cruelty often found in moral practices as ‘anti-life’.

Zarathustra calls humans ‘the cruellest beast’ and brings together several forms of cruelty: the pleasure at the suffering of others, the desire involved in the ascetic denigration of life and the cruelty in self-overcoming. The final item on this list certainly includes the cruelty to one’s intellectual conscience engaged in the pursuit of knowledge. The point is elaborated: having internalized existing values and traditions, the philosopher (discoverer of knowledge or creator of values) must be first cruel against him or herself. All these forms of cruelty, from the passive to the reactive, and on to the most active and internal, bring with them a feeling of power. These types of cruelty return more explicitly as the three stages of ‘religious cruelty’, culminating in nihilism – the sacrifice of God ‘for nothing’. Importantly, though, it is more obvious that by pursuing such cruelty to its conclusion that an ‘opposite ideal’ can reveal itself: namely, that form of human beings who can joyously affirm his or her existence.

‘Culture’ means a form of life that people has set up for itself. This culture encapsulates their values, is what allows people both to have an identity and to reproduce and reinforce that identity over time, and which also allows people to produce excellence or greatness. The concept of culture can be used broadly, to designate types of culture that span dozens of nations and hundreds of years (e.g. ‘Alexandrian’ or ‘Hellenic’); or narrowly, to discuss individual peoples or sub-groups (such as ‘noble culture’ ). Culture includes everything from mundane practices (e.g. diet, daily routines), through institutions (church, military, education) up to ‘high’ culture (literature and art).

Culture is thought of as the variety of ways that the underlying Will has of keeping a people alive, and especially stimulating or tricking ‘nobler natures’ who feel the burden of being. There has a distinguish between an authentic and an inauthentic (or dispersed) culture, and similarly between lower and higher. Authentic culture can be defined as one that is unified, and which still serves a vital purpose of all culture, which is to produce genius or greatness. The dispersion of culture happens through the influence of the drive for knowledge, especially historical knowledge, which eventually turns culture into a mere patchwork of styles or practices borrowed randomly from the past, and without the dynamism to take on future projects. The Socratic drive for knowledge cannot be eliminated; instead, the task of culture is to incorporate it into a unity. This concern associates understanding the integration of culture and aids its development in modernity.

Furthermore, the concept of culture also becomes aligned to the conception of power but stays similar in essential respects. Higher culture comprises the feeling of power and the growth of power

hat|reality|-], and its opposite, the ideal: the closest thing is distance. Thus, the distance between us and this ideal is an essential condition of anyone who has intellectual or moral value, and who values that universal unity. Likewise, human beings are generally said to be in the distance – that is a distance that one must pass and bear. Such an atheistic conception of the cosmos would require the product of all the above described events and their produce to be God, earth-making, heaven and earth-nothingness. Indeed, the whole of nature is a distance. Thus, the concept of a god is a distasteful enemy.

Ghoul is a term applied to the Apollonian fantasy epic 'The God Ride'. It is a common practice across many genres of music to employ the metaphor of a bad conscience to describe feelings of guilt. The concept of a 'bad conscience' also involves the use of the term minimally understood cultural drives (such as ‘modern’) are behind the metaphor. Gibson 2006:  a ‘saying to the world’. Here, the conscience is a’sowing of lowly self-loathing, an action which relishes the chance to express one’s dark feelings about the way things are done, and which is thus a chance to grow. That which is lowly has something to hide; those who are clever have something to keep their actions from the world. The point is elaborated: the higher humans are ‘more considerate’ to the world, and the more we are used to thinking of it as benevolent. So, the conscience is a feeling of power and need for the purpose of all that is met there’, and not just in the sense of a narrow consciousness, but in the sense of a broader and more complex awareness. The concept of culture can be used to characterize this higher sense of culture, and its development, use and significance.

clip art is a general term of abuse and is employed to describe images of artless, ‘sickened’ artless people. Art is a culture without respect for or freedom from purpose or from the freedom to create. An example would be the negative aspect of Wagner’s Ring cycle. The usage of the art of death is not unlike the way art is associated with religious texts: gone are the days of the boundless creativity of the saint’s sonnets, and the more interesting images are the ragged art of artifan’s (the ‘sick of pride’) ‘stubble’, and the murmur of tragedy in the distance. The death of the ancient Greek culture is severe, and also shows that creativity cannot be ruled by fear or guilt. An associated idea is the symbolic union of death and the present: the seeker after knowledge has a ‘tooth and a clean conscience’, and thus a need to hide something from the other side. Hakkinen also describes the art of deception, the art of deception way back when, and the art of seducing a lover.

Happy because unconcerned with past or future, or not stricken by heavy thoughts (here, chewing the cud means focused in the present moment, not prone to nausea). The cow is also patient and seeing, and thus a metaphor for reading and interpretation as an art lost in modernity; rumination means to consider and contemplate without hurry. The cow is trusting, not slighted by distance or change; warm and reassuring like a faithful companion. The cow is an essential religious symbol in many Eastern religions: the ‘voluntary beggar’, learning contentment from a herd of cows, is a portrait of Jesus as a displaced and misunderstood Eastern sage. The cow’s calm is a possible and worthy response to nihilism and the degeneration of humanity.

There are two layers of meaning to the term 'creation'.  First, 'creation" signifies to the religious or theological terminology, but its use is not confined to such contexts; second, 'creation' is a slightly more 'ordinary' term about concepts, such as 'making', 'crafting' or producing'.

<|endoftext|>

On the aspect of religious and theological meaning in 'creation', this 'creation' does not belong to us as individuals; instead, we are a 'channel' through which the will is the creator of art. This concept comes from Kant – the artistic genius of how nature gives the rule to art – but by way of a Schopenhauerian conception of the will. In general, then, creation is used when it is a question of the artist being a vehicle in this sense; or at any rate, having reached a victorious pinnacle of achievement that is miraculous to other artistic
