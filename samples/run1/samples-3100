 develop and continues to evolve. The primary condition of communication is the sharing of a language – a system of values – with another human being. Therefore, the primary condition of communication, the basis of both moral and economic activity, is the sharing of a language. The formation of a person or a people involves a rejection or an alteration of the nature of the communication. Because of the rejection or an alteration, communication often follows a modified version of the pathos of distance, naming those stages of the process that continue in adulthood. These modified forms are called ‘personal functions’. There is a period of at least three decades or more before the formation of a person or a people – and this is associated with the decay of the sense of power or the decline of individual ambition’. It is related to the rumination of lives or ideas. The discussion of death is thus about both the fragmentary nature of human experience and the overall chaotic nature of human thought and behaviour.

However, the consideration of death as an important concept does not stop at the concept of fate.  There are also broader and more specific concerns about the 'history of death' that involve the positing of two notions – the necessity of a transcendent human being in the world and a metaphysical error that this human must be sacrificed to make things right.

Dance is defined as a display of strength and agility, but one that is graceful, as if only a sign of still further reserves of strength and agility, which the description could also be of the noble. The ancient Greeks lived dancelike in this sense; dialogue in Sophocles has this character. Dance thus serves as an analogy for Dionysian insight apprehended calmly in an Apollonian vision; for the overcoming of shame in the healthy and beautiful body; likewise, for the conception of freedom of will as self-determination, taking leave of certainty and dancing beside the abyss – this notion should recall the tight rope ‘dancer’; and generally as the ideal of philosophy, which needs to be able to work with both science and art, accomplished in both but constrained by neither, even though this means an absolute inevitable scientific ignorance. German philosophers got criticised, for whom thinking is nothing like dancing, struggling without a ‘finger for nuance’. Wagner is found – and implicitly criticised – for moving music away from dance and its ideal of self-possession even amidst emotional enthusiasm.

Zarathustra walks like a dancer, a sign of the self-overcoming during his long sojourn in the mountains. ‘The Dance Song’ is explicitly there to advocate against the ‘spirit of gravity’, the enemy of anyone who would seek to overcome such burdens. In accord with this conception of dance, we have the famous lines ‘one must have chaos within one still to give birth to a dancing star’, and ‘I would only believe in a God who knew how to dance’. To the latter is contrasted the discontented God who created an ‘eternally imperfect’ world – that is a world characterised by illusion, suffering and dependence. Such a god suffers and, in revenge, wants to make suffering. The dancing god, on the other hand, is Dionysus. Both are projections of human ideals, but the latter is of a healthy form of human life and one aligned to the nature of life as will to power.

The idea of danger is employed in several interconnected ways. First, the danger is the ‘mother of morality’. That is, moral systems and other forms of values arise to fix in place a working social arrangement, one that offers stability and security to the group. Second, though, this same stability itself endangers the health or growth of life. So, the priestly type is ‘a dangerous form of human existence’, and likewise, the good and righteous are the ‘greatest danger to all human future’. Third, those factors that are a specific danger to the development of a philosopher (specialization, intellectual conscience, or the need to revalue those values assigned to live). For an earlier example, see also the ‘three dangers’ that confronted Schopenhauer. Similarly, there is the danger attached to philosophical knowledge itself. That is, if absolute falsehoods or simplifications are a condition of life, then bringing these into question will be a danger both to the questioner and to existing forms of human life. Accordingly, the passage to the ‘over human’ will be a ‘dangerous across’, and Zarathustra praises the tight-rope walker for making ‘danger your vocation’. The image of the tight-rope walker brings us to the fourth meaning: danger as a duty.

Cultural advancement happens through conflict; likewise, the history of scientific development and the development of dialectic in philosophy and ultimately of logic ('Socrates and Tragedy'); the best friendship comes to a standstill after the third world war, when the rule of the weak was overcome by the will to the truth. Indeed, the best friendship is not an agreement but antagonism: thus, friendship without prejudice. Friend or foe, this antagonism takes the form of a struggle or contest, which the Philosopher will try to overcome. The goal is friendship only if and when it is to be achieved in accordance with the laws.

The notion of the impotence of will to power is an area where allegory falls under. Theaggregation is a generalization of theosophical thought, but more specifically an 'Aristotle'. Aristotle is an essential source of the 'Iliad', along with many later Apollonian works.

Ass can be a general term of abuse, connoting above all stupidity and dullness or slowness. All humans, from a higher perspective, are idiotic. To the concept of ass, the distinctive braying is ‘i-a’, thus ‘jay’ or yes – the ass stands for indiscriminate affirmation, lack of taste. The ass sometimes replaces such meanings as stubborn, enduring, and even intelligent; as a weight-bearing creature, the figure of the ass sometimes overlaps with the more familiar image of the camel. The festival of the ass is akin to one aspect of the Greek ‘Dionysian’ festival – the suspension of cultural and social order; likewise, there are Medieval traditions with a similar theme. Also, the ass is made sacred in some myths of Dionysus. Moreover, worshipping the ass is akin to the final nihilistic stages of religion, but here in a joyous and festive spirit.

A modern conception of space means the vast, mostly empty and cold distances between stars or planets – an excellent symbolic vehicle for his notions of the pathos of distance (‘too distant star’), the infrequent appearance of greatness, nobility, friendship, solitude (the image of the star emitting light into the darkness, also notice the allusion to solar flares) or untimeliness (‘the light of the stars needs time’ ). Likewise, it serves to convey the cosmic insignificance of human beings and even the chaotic nature of reality overall. Similarly, also the methods of astronomy are employed: not seeing the stars as ‘above you’ – that is not transcendent in nature.

In its primary sense, atheism is the positive assertion of the non- existence of anything like a god. To be sure, nothing like a god exists as either a positing of anything like a god or a being of at least some kind. To be sure, nothing like a god isomorphic to anything like a human. Likewise, nothing like a god is posited as something that could be or should be. Reality thus becomes a god’s creation. However, in some cases, a god is explicitly said to be behind everything else. Thus, the metaphysical question of whether god is real is at best an anthropomorphism. Second, though, there is a significant difference: the first (theistic) is about values and perspective points, to be relevant only to those ‘where’ gods are’ founded. Third, even the concept of a god’s existence as such is sublimated by the notion of a god:  there is nothing like a god to be specific about existence or nature. There is indeed only that impression of some supreme being, a  brief period of blissful ignorance in the presence of the gods (‘immaculate perception’), followed by a shudder, then a dream, then a hallucination, then a state in which the real is unreal. A third possibility is that the real is what is supposed to be, to be a fake, of which there is no real. Fourth, there is the thought of a fourth world country,  to be different from, and to be lacking in, the other three. There is also a thought experiment in which theories of language and narrative are employed to try to understand how these cultural drives were harnessed and employed in the development of the concept of human.

A dog is a domesticated, and degraded, beast of prey. Thus, it is both suddenly aggressive, and contemptible in its display of cowardliness, distress, or anger. Having been a slave, it has become nothing other than a slave. Thus, the dog is a crucial analogy for internalization, the

Affirmation is a yes-saying in two senses. First, a yes-saying to life, to fate, and to all the suffering or senseless destruction they in fact do and must-have, even those 'beneath' us are necessary for the perfection of the world. This first idea of affirmation is linked to the notions of amor fate and eternal recurrence. Second, affirmation specifies a mode of life the values and projects these values onto the human, group, or relational group. These two senses are closely related; indeed, they both describe aspects of a system or life that is typically thought of as working against itself. The first concerns the embracing of the whole system: our relationship to the real is not productive, and therefore not healthy. The second concerns the development of a comprehensive ‘new morality’: the new perspective may involve a revaluation of values. Third, affirmation specifies a mode of life that is based on the acceptability of values, rather than on the value of facts or life facts. These two senses are closely related; indeed, they both describe aspects of a system or life. The acceptability of values must be replaced by a ‘new morality’. This new morality must be able to work with and beyond the system. The system, though, is not the final word—it must first be understood as a totality of affects and effects, to be able to support a positing of a transcendent or metaphorical character. This notion of the system of life is in full swing in modernity; indeed, with the system, the affects can now be posited with a humanity capable of creation. Institutions like education have to create a genuine and living soul; or, the good and righteous and creative forces can find a way to preserve and even enhance themselves. A class system is, then, for as long as it serves this end’s end – that is, until such time as a new class revolutionizes the course of human history. It is thus a dangerous course. The system of life that it serves is present within all human societies, and even in the closest of instances, will ensure its existence for all eternity. Thus, the system of life founded upon the enhancement of power and the enhancement of power is a system ‘of lies’. The existence of a ‘cheerfulness’ to the system of life is intrinsic to the human, and also contributes to the high incidence of moralistic and religious thought. That is, the human being already is in some way 'cheerful’, and this cheerfulness is somehow not to be ashamed of having reached that height, to the point where the contempt for the body no longer exists. This point is made concerning the memorably named applause line. A more complex analogy of cheerfulness is used to discuss the idea of empathy: having more in common with that which is despised is illusory consolation. Likewise, and again, the point is made that while cheerfulness is an element in the noble, pragmatic sense, we should treat it as such: having value requires we adopt a higher morality.

Cultural advancement happens through conflict; likewise, the history of scientific advancement is rife with battles over concepts and the like.  At the root of this modern concept is the ‘modern’ concept of the herd. The ‘herd animal’ is defined up to and continues into the modern period. This notion of feminine is at the root of many philosophical questions, such as the concept of domestication or domestication of the animal, or the role of feminine in these discussions. Also, the role of feminine in philosophy is enormous. The utility of the concept of feminine is that it relates to both the origin of values and the development of human values since then, and likewise to a future in which feminine is no longer antagonistic to masculine values. Also, the concept of feminine in poetry is vast and continuous; indeed, it often links to other meanings related to feminine, such as courage or beauty. The feminine also is associated with the development of the stage and with the development of lyric poetry.

The eagle’s standard of living is not excellent, but it is certainly not wretched. The ordinary human is, then, in the highest sense of the eagle; and this is in opposition to the will to power. The eagle’s cunning is to be distinguished from the human’s cunning in the highest sense. A cunning is, then, a kind of strength that the human is too clever to be of use to the other side. A cunning is also considered as the cultivation
