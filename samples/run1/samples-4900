 For a given situation, it follows that the system of life – and the system of life as conceived prior to Kant – must be in danger of falling prey to a ‘critique’. The critique changes its subject, and the term of decadence is born. A new form of life, one that values individual achievement, involves the self-critique of values, and calls for a revision of the social structure. This is liberal in a sense, especially in the sphere of culture. But it is a decay that must be accounted for in terms of a decline in the value of the system of life, or a degeneration of the will.

Decadent is a term applied to Greek civilisation about the period from the decline of the first industrial level to the present. It is early Christians, associated with Palo Alto, who were both prodigious communicators and masters of the marketplace. Later, merchants in Rome were called delinquents. It is modern critics, though, and critics of the state often are. The philosopher must be able to critique such corrupted values. Thus, the delinquency label is about someone who has disrupted the order in which things were or should be.

Furthermore, delinquency is a term applied to former values, to those objects of the ascetic ideal who can be liberated from their bondage under a new system of life. For example, the notion of abstinence from certain present values, even those that dissent from a value system. Particularly concerning is the fact that such a revaluation of values takes place in history; that is, the need to revalue values. Indeed, as far as the present is a question of the ascetic ideal – and not just any historical moment – then the ascetic ideal is the ideal of the able artist taking on the task of the investigation of the many ills of present life, in particular mental illness, which is oftenka socionika (journaling and the taking charge of an ideal).

Although in philosophical history the abyss has not been an unmediated or even perspectival sphere, the concept of the abyss has become a comprehensive concept that allows us to better understand how that history or culture work together. For example, the abyss is a metaphor for the lack of communication of information (noise, image, lightness) and thus also for the lack of clarity as to what is apparent or even possible. The idea of abyss has influence both with the ‘history of philosophy’ and with the ‘development of a comprehensive culture’.

The abyss is a literal meaning that one can step out before the stars – that is, not only to avoid them but also to communicate to and receive information from the stars. The idea is that any deviation from the pathos of distance or monotony will be a deviation from this pathos, and will involve a rejection of the system of nature. Thus, the abyss shows the necessary courage to accept the prophetic dream of God, who will crush all things, exaltation, and beauty.

An allegory is an image (visual or described in language) that has a certain coherence on its terms (is, for example, a recognisable thing, a character, a narrative) but also carries a symbolic meaning. This is conventional for a few added examples. Allegory can be termed ‘ironic’ when the allegorical vehicle already has a symbolic meaning of its own, but something else is meant. An example would be the use of the image of the heavens. The heavens become a symbol of the absence of providence.

Philosophical thinking about the nature of allegory begins early. While music is understood to be directly symbolic of the original unity of things, lyric poetry employs allegories to try the same symbolic work.  The same point is made concerning the allegorical nature of myth. The pure musical route, though, is untranslatable or incommunicable, and thus is not anything like an insight into or wisdom concerning the original unity. Thus, while Apollonian images are appearances – and thus,  it would seem something like the opposite of knowledge  – when they function as allegories, they are in fact an important mechanism of wisdom.

Even your best love is only a rapturous allegory. Here we have a factual situation (love or marriage) carrying symbolic meaning for those involved in that situation and for others. This is a case of a particular image (real marriage) that symbolises an idea but also serve as a set of practices or institutions that may inspire one to understand or pursue that ideal. In this case, the ideal is the role of masculine and feminine drives within the total health of both organism and culture. There

 For them, the ideal is the ascending out of allogratiness, and the plateau as the stage of artistic development. Cleverness also means clarity, bringing to mind the subtlety of sand dunes.

Cheerfulness is an essential characteristic of the higher culture, to the point that the difference is apparent in expression and is a point of pride. Likewise, it is the contrast between this higher and lower culture, the feeling of power and the elevation of greatness. Thus, the highest human can feel the joy of achievement, but the lower humans feel the pang of guilt over what they have done. In other words, there is no such thing as a noble or sublime sense of happiness, or high achieving individuals or families.

The notion of culture has a long history of philosophy, beginning with Aristotle. There have multiple accounts of the development of culture, from the superficial to the highest, and the following are critical for this notion of progress: the ‘free-doer’, the philosopher of the cave (‘cunning at the cave’), and the philosopher of the cave must be both ‘cheerful’ and ‘live dangerously’. It is the opposite of the warm and fuzzy feelings that are characteristic of the human, and is thus also a characteristic of a sleeping philosopher. Cheerfulness is thought of as an effect of the exercise of power, or as an effect of the calmness that comes with having both ears to hear and both feet to walk. Likewise, it is a characteristic of the noble that he or she has both the strength and the wisdom to remain cheerful. Similarly, benevolence must also be associated with the stability of the herd.

In general, the cat is an incompletely domesticated animal that it appears peaceful, loves comfort, but has a residual wildness, remains akin to a beast of prey and is mischievous or wilful. Also, the clouds are implied to cats, incapable of decision; and, cats are also compared with the figure of a woman. But the cat is incapable of giving, reciprocity or love. In this, it is the opposite of the dog—moreover, the images of granite statues of cats, standing for old-fashioned values, heavy and unmovable.

The notion of ‘category’ has a long history of philosophy, beginning with Aristotle. In Kant, the categories form a set of 12 essential and a priori concepts under which all experience falls. They thus describe the structure of experience and its limits but also supply a transcendental account of how knowledge is possible in the first place.

Causality is one of the critical physical and metaphysical lines of thought. There are several aspects. There are clear evidence of the necessity of the collapses of the first and second order, and of the necessity of alsofalling all experience. Also, there are clear instances of a continuum of – and therefore, existence – appearing to be opposite forces. Also, there are clear examples of transcendence or not at all follows a characterisation of events as if they were present. Moreover, there is a danger of the becoming of something other than the life-giving nature. This is represented by the images of a cave illuminated by night and day; the snake pit (asceticism) and the associated images in mythology; the feeling of power and place (agon). These modern ideas of the solitary and protective nature of cave; the idea that cave is a metaphor for the sublimation of wildness by sunlight; the cave is also a term of abuse. When we talk about the ‘discipline of manners’, it refers to the amount of ‘cheerfulness’ in the presence of a superior being, and not in the trivial sense of a passion. Similarly, the cleverness in the self-control to one’s age’, and not to exhaustion after a long illness. The mention of the cave, especially as something ‘cheerful’, serves to underline the contrast between this noble lack of veneration for the solitude of solitude and the much more common habit of following a herd or smallholders. Thus, the cave is also a metaphor for a kind of internalization of the cave (religious practices).

Cheerfulness, most often, but the concept shades into other words that might otherwise be interpreted as happiness or joyfulness. Optimism cannot be a consequence of a lack of awareness of pain, cruelty or destructiveness – because this was the people that invented tragedy and celebrated the wisdom of Silenus – nor could it be a consequence of ‘unendangered ease and comfort’, or pure sensuality, because then philosophy would never

 For the preservation of the ideal constitution, specific acts of cruelty against oneself (self-deception), or ignorance of fate all play a role.

'Beyond Good and Evil' is notable for a more explicit discussion than is found outside his notebooks of the metaphysics that underlies N's reflections on morality and religion (e.g. the concept of the will to power). There are also nicely focused chapters on faith and virtue. The book ends with an essential evocation of the figure of Dionysus.

The Old Testament is one of the greatest, certainly the most sublime, pieces of literature, and the record of a great people. The New Testament a distasteful account of a catastrophic turn in European history. Luther's translation of the Bible into German is one of the critical events of the reformation and had a substantial formative effect upon the history of German. 'Beyond Good and Evil' is full of references to biblical events and persons, either for direct discussion or metaphorically (i.e. the images of love, gift and sacrifice are allusions to the life of Christ).

The bird is a symbol of rapid ascent, of something that needs and desires to be ahead of its time, to show spiritual growth. Birds must also be light, able to throw off burdens. The bird is thus in opposition to the spirit of heaviness. The flock of doves is precisely chosen because it is a conventional symbol of gentleness and peace but combined with the bird’s lightness and need for the ascent, and this is unlike a herd of sheep or cows, say. The dove image also has significant biblical echoes.

The eagle (Adler) is the most common bird mentioned in N. The most famous use of the eagle is the symbol of a healthy and honest pride. The eagle can view things as beneath it; this is both a specific comprehensive sight which is not an abstraction and honest pride. The snake is cleverness. The combination of these animals (the eagle carrying the snake) is something rare: those who have pride do not understand themselves; those who are clever tend to be self-loathing. It seems likely that they also represent two significant mythic and cultural inputs into Europe, the eagle as the masculine Greek, the serpent as the feminine Judaic; their union is an expression of an as yet unrealised ‘wholeness’ of the human. The eagle is a bird of prey. Birds and especially the eagle, thus also stand for a kind of strength. Its happiness lies in relishing the terror of the great heights and the abyss, rather than in ignorance of that terror. Moreover, the eagle’s hunt is direct, straight down; it is thus, considered on its own, a noble ‘stupidity’. It is nourished on innocence, it both loves and hates the lamb – thus mirroring the relationship to the human, which is loved because of its yet unspoiled possibilities.

‘The Birth of Tragedy’, with its lack of scholarly apparatus, energetic and figure-laden prose, philosophical and psychological speculation, and a mixture of ancient and modern contexts, was not what the philological community expected. It has three primary purposes and correspondingly divides into three sections. First, to elaborate a theory of ancient Greek tragedy as a synthesis of two metaphysically understood cultural drives (Apollonian and Dionysian). In this way, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ solves the relationship between cheerfulness and pessimism ingeniously - how could the Greeks, with their in-depth knowledge of suffering and futility, have remained cheerful? Second, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ traces the reasons for the decline of tragedy to a third drive, the Socratic, which is also the advent of science and modernity. Third, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ seeks to understand what it would mean, and what it would take, for tragedy to be reborn in the present. The account of culture is thus revealed to be a general one, and not specific to Greece. The book is heavily influenced (although not entirely uncritically) by Schopenhauer, and especially in its third part plays homage to Wagner.

Otto von Bismarck was the leading political figure in Germany from the 1860s to 1890. Bismarck provoked wars that in turn led to the unification of Germany around Prussian leadership. His brand of pragmatic and power politics, and his nationalism, made him as a symbol of all that was wrong with modern Germany.
