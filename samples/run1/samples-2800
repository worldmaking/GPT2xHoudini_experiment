 transcend|‘greater’ humanity. Key to ‘greater’ is the understanding that certain cultural practices (e.g. ‘echosophical practices’), are associated with beauty (   practices that are ascetic). These practices may be ascetic in character but are also in the spirit of a productive subtlety in the war against the barbarians.

Ascetic values is a rather abstract concept that relates to certain values, but also to other values, such as justice, honesty, or the pursuit of happiness. Thus, atheism in its primary sense is that which stays ascetic; atheism in its second sense is that which philosophers have domesticated (discovered). Thus, asceticism is a world of isolated and unrealized possibilities, full of human possibilities, and illuminated only by a darkness that needs to be understood as belonging to something higher. This darkness is temporary and does not threaten to dissolve the human. Because of its beauty, asceticism is considered as the transformation of the earth itself. That is, the earth is given back its ancient beauty and its abundance, rather than inherited it.

Ascetic ideals’ pervasiveness crosses many aspects of human life. The chief purpose of the Treatise is not about the ascetic ideal per se, but either proving the inescapable nature of will to power or proving the art of interpretation—the various analyses of the austere ideal supply evidence for these. The Treatise then forms a series of studies of the meaning of the ascetic ideal in artists, philosophers, the weak and ill and in priests. The discussion of the philosopher is significant, for here the ascetic ideal shows its often-overlooked positive aspect, as the search for the conditions of spiritual growth and elevation, like the abstinence and careful mode of life of an athlete in training. Asceticism is a way of diverting the course of one’s life onto the right path, the path that leads to another world or after-life. This means, though, that asceticism is a mode of living that seeks to cancel out experience – but that is a contradiction, and (at least at the physiological level) must be only an appearance. That is, the ascetic ideal must be somehow a way of a degenerated life-preserving itself at all costs. The priest is a kind of ‘doctor’ to the sick, serving to change the direction of their ressentiment to make it harmless. Instruments to this end are described from sections 17 to 20.  This institutionalisation of the sick and weak is also a valuable separation of them from the healthy. Both science and historiography (history understood as a scientific undertaking) are complicit in the ascetic ideal; likewise, atheism which stays ascetic in its will to the truth. In the end, the ideal ascetic means that the will to power can will anything (even nothingness), but cannot will  – that is to say, the ascetic ideal is the last recourse of a diseased form of life attempting to prevent itself falling into a ‘suicidal nihilism’. How the dangerous aspects of the ascetic ideal are to be overcome is not focused on here. There are two clues: first, through comedy, that is through a light-footed, mocking irreverence; second, through the will to the truth coming to consciousness not as a principle but as a problem. Asceticism can be naturalised, that is a return to the original Greek concept of askesis (training), a discipline of improving strength and health.

‘Asia’ or the ‘East’ usually delivers to the following ideas that Russia as a significant rival to European power, or as a critical origin for nihilism and anarchism;  culture, social systems or philosophical systems in India or China, founded on Hinduism or Buddhism; relatedly, China about its capacity for an industrious class without resentment; the area to the east of Greek civilisation, particularly as the ‘prehistory’ of the Dionysian.

Ass can be a general term of abuse, connoting above all stupidity and dullness or slowness. All humans, from a higher perspective, are idiotic. To the concept of ass, the distinctive braying is ‘i-a’, thus ‘jay’ or yes – the ass stands for indiscriminate affirmation, lack of taste. The ass sometimes replaces such meanings as stubborn, enduring, and even intelligent; as a weight-bearing creature, the figure of the ass sometimes overlaps with the more familiar image of the camel. The festival of the ass is akin to one aspect of the Greek ‘Dionysian’ festival – the suspension of cultural and social order; likewise, there are Medieval

 transcendent reality. Instead, some will find their domain – their identity and future – illuminated. Beauty urges one towards the production of beauty.  Beauty urges one towards the formation of a higher power. This is one reason beauty is such a crucial characteristic of the Tragic Detectives. Beauty is a wardrobe trick – and a crucial aspect of the overall 'modern fashion'. Thus, the portrayal of beauty is a key feature of the overall 'role of culture' this redesignates as 'modern'.

Beauty is an ideal that a culture can and should have, for its growth and development. The spectacle of ascending life is beautiful; degeneration is ugliness. As again in Plato, an attraction in itself is not the goal or endpoint, but instead either a sign of health or that which ‘lures’ one towards further creation (the soft voice of beauty and wisdom and life personified). Thus, needs and desires should be met in one place and with great perfection. Thus, the portrayal of beauty, as far as it may appear natural and healthy, is not the goal or endpoint of culture or art.

<|endoftext|>

Beauty is a quality of the ideal (e.g. the gods) that a people can and should have. The ideal must be able to take on all the associated risks and risks that come along the way of life (e.g. culture, art, science, morality). The spectacle of ascending life is thus both an affirmation of the present status of the human, and a test of the will to power. Thus, the spectacle of ascending life is the moment of perfection and stillness that Zarathustra experiences after his frantic search for the origin of the 'cry of distress'. Here, the journey is not necessarily about the resolute, but more ideal aspects: the pessimist can live on, the seeker after the pure; and the finder of knowledge can lead the human towards its possibilities. Such an ideal is beautiful; accordingly, it is also a stage – not a goal or endpoint; and not even within this system of power relations or ideas. Such an ideal is not what is beautiful, and again, the route to power is not the noble, but the ‘slanderer’.

<|endoftext|>

Beauty is a quality of the noble type that can be associated with a noble class or a people. The noble types are those who are incapable of giving, who are incapable of returning. The type who is capable of giving is a type of the noble. The nobility can also be associated, for the noble type is a culture capable of creating and then bringing about its full beauty. The type who is incapable of giving is incapable of bringing wisdom. Such an idea is unattainable. The type should be incapable of creating. Such an idea of the noble as ‘noble’ inherits its nourishment from the ‘evil’ part of the 'enlightenment’. In general, the 'noble' uncleanliness of attire is in contradiction to the Epictetusian example. For this reason, the introduction of the feminine into the wardrobe isaccompanied by a second contrast, this time with the austere ideal of the former. This third contrast is significant because it values appearance and therefore involves a questioning of values. Thus, the feminine and masculine become interchangeable. The emphasis now is on the ‘semi-nomads’, who are also nomadic peoples with limited resources and dangerous beliefs. The dominant culture in the ancient world was the Dionysian, and this cultural adaptation has been going on for some 32,000 years. The series of cultural revolutions that have taken place in Europe and the eighteenth century have been marred by the cultural paralysis that has afflicted modernity. This paralyzes the thinker, who must resort to metaphysics to understand the nature of reality (the duality of experience and values). The philosopher must be able to ‘convince the Greek’ people that they are a people capable of genuine culture’. The goal here is to force the philosopher, particularly the ‘dressed in navy blue robes’, to accept the role of art history and Broadway musical allegory, thereby preserving his or her historical sense of things.

The symbols of feminine and masculine are employed to symbolize and explore many difficult aspects of metaphysics. The symbols also appear to be appropriate for readers of ancient Greek literature.

On the notion of innocence elsewhere, especially in modernity, the concept of innocence is often lacking. This innocence is represented by the rote memoranda (without pre-determinism),  or by the activity of few pervasivenesss (more acceptable: chase after the ungodliness of things, pure chance). The significance of this habitability lies in the fact

 transcendological characterizations of suffering (i.e. from the notion of suffering in the soul), rather than in the actual or the unreal, is the ‘wretched reality’ of Dionysus. The thought of humanity as ‘beyond’ the metaphysics and metaphysics that are present in metaphysics and have no real relationship to anything real. Moreover, many of the concepts of the transcendent (i.e. what are merely interpretations) are already founded upon a metaphysical conception of human being. This leads us to the third problem. What is the metaphysics of askesis? The account of why there are two halves to the original concept of Dionysus goes beyond just ‘new horizons’. Considerations such as the lens through which the Apollonian is used (e.g. observation, reasoning, law or order) or the notion of mythic symbols (‘metaphysical reality’). Rather, this account of the Dionysian must involve a denigration of the body and a questioning of the will to power. Such denigration, in turn, would have to occur within the framework of the Dionysian itself. Here, the anthropologist must overcome the ‘fishing instinct’ to understand the impact of the in-laws within the paleofantasy of the ‘prehistory’ of the Apollonian. The anthropologist must be able to see with enough distance that things are already dark and murky, and enough to allow her or his or her ways to be guided.

The tiger is one of the animals associated in mythology with Dionysus, which explicitly refers to fat. The tiger’s wildness is not tamed by, but directly not opposed to Dionysus’ needs or purposes. As one lush growth of the tropical south, the tiger is a symbol of wanton and sudden destructiveness (always about to leap) and over-abundance (‘Homer’s Contest’). Thus, also the tiger is the figure of that sudden urge to traitorous injustice among the Greeks, which requires the state to keep it in check. This tension can be seen negatively as unresolved, lacking perfection or direction. The ‘higher men’ are compared to a tiger that has failed in its leap – that is, ashamed of their action, and not accepting the role of chance in the growth of the human.

In general, the cat is an incompletely domesticated animal that it appears peaceful, loves comfort, but has a residual wildness, remains akin to a beast of prey and is mischievous or wilful. Also, the clouds are implied to cats, incapable of decision; and, cats are also compared with the figure of a woman. However, the cat is incapable of giving, reciprocity or love. In this, it is the opposite of the dog—moreover, the images of granite statues of cats, standing for old-fashioned values, heavy and unmovable.

The notion of ‘category’ has a long history of philosophy, beginning with Aristotle. In Kant, the categories form a set of 12 essential and a priori concepts under which all experience falls. They thus describe the structure of experience and its limits but also supply a transcendental account of how knowledge is possible in the first place.

Causality is one of the critical physical and metaphysical lines of thought. There are several aspects. Although using some of the same concepts as ‘On Truth and Lies’useful as a kind of shorthand for describing and predicting, the concepts of cause and effect require us to posit the cause and the effect as separable and identifiable; that is, each must be a stable entity. In truth, a continuum faces us, and every causal event is an infinite number of processes. Cause and effect thus offer no real understanding or explanation. This simplifying treatment of cause and effect is founded upon a natural, but mistaken, analysis of will – our clear willing and effecting becomes a model for natural processes. Cause and effect do not follow ‘laws. This notion of natural law as something that ‘governs’ also is an illegitimate application of our (mistaken) notion of willing according to a maxim. The critique of causality also amounts to an evaluation of mechanical thought (all nature consists of pushing and pulling entities). Natural causality is replaced by the concept of a network of forces – that is with the will to power. Among other things, this new concept demands (as against mechanism) ‘action at a distance’. Importantly,  this concept of cause and effect includes a diagnosis of the psychological needs that might explain its adoption.
