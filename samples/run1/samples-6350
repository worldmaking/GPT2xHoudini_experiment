There are three critical aspects to the conception about death. The first and most apparent revolves around those values or beliefs that involve a denigration or even rejection of life – either this life (as opposed to the ‘afterlife’) or aspects associated with the living body (sex, passion, pleasure, etc.). A key passage in this regard would be Zarathustra on the ‘preachers of death’. The rejection of life on the part of the ascetic priest is only clear; such asceticism is a means to carry on living despite suffering and degeneration. A related idea is a danger that the philosopher will meet in his or her attempt to overcome values. The death of the tight-rope walker, who made danger his ‘vocation’, is an example. Finally, metaphysics will often involve a conceptual rejection of becoming or a positing of facts and values as eternal. This is often described with metaphors of death: for example, the ‘mummified concepts.

The ‘death of God’ is the second notion. Belief in God – and the values that go with such belief – is no longer possible or relevant within modernity. This is both a liberation but also a crushing blow (for it means that the burden of creating and justifying values falls upon the human). Here, ‘death’ means old, weak, irrelevant, but also historical, transient, and indeed not eternal. 

<|endoftext|>

The third concerns are either the notion of euthanasia or the relation of life to the thought of mortality. Some of the most beautiful passages are pleas for a ‘rational’ or ‘free’ death, one that precisely from out of ‘love of life’ does not allow the body entirely to outlive its usefulness and capacity for action. The thought of death should mix a drop of ‘foolishness’ into life, rather than gloom; this is partly because, without the need to come rapidly to a judgement about the significant issues for the sake of one’s eternal soul, the thought of our mortality frees us to have time for experimentation, and even for mistakes. Individuals should have more reasons to focus on life and joy in life rather than death.

The term of decadence with similar meanings include 'degeneration' and 'corruption'. 'Decadent' was a term of abuse used by French neo-classical or conservative critics against the romanticism of painters like Delacroix or novelists such as Hugo. Later, writers like Baudelaire adopted the term as their own, using it to express scepticism towards many dominant moral or political values. The usage of the word 'decadence' late in the late nineteenth centuries has represented the concepts of corruption, decline or degeneration date. Baudelaire is termed 'a typical decadency', and all references to him associate him with Wagner (Baudelaire was one of Wagner's champions in France). So, the meaning of 'decadence' is any period of cultural history – or any state of the human organism – which has lost its good taste and value judgement  (thus it is associated with pity; with Kantian duty; with Schopenhauer's quieting of the will), health and sureness of instinct, discipline and sense of a future. It is to be associated either with the decline of old cultures or with moral revolutions.

The Kantian and Platonic-Christian metaphysical distinction between appearance and ‘true world’ is termed a ‘sign of decadence’. For all these reasons at Christianity is called a ‘monster of decadence’. Decadent cultures are exhausted cultures, and such cultures often exhibit a pathological over-sensitivity; indeed, often an inability not to respond, lacking the strength to inhibit one’s passions. Alternatively, the decadent culture can manifest itself as a craving for stimulation (for the voluptuous, the exotic, the dangerous). Importantly, this desire for stimulation is a symptom and not a cause – as those who react ascetically against such stimulation believe. Thus, decadence in the form of a culture of exhaustion that needs stimulation often precipitates a reaction, which is the ‘gathering gloom of the religious-moral pathos’.

Most of the above could serve as an account of the notion of degeneration or corruption also. If there is a distinction to be drawn from decadence, degeneration tends to have a stronger physiological

 can be accounted for by education or expertise; instead, most importantly, the noble involves a consolidation of a herd or herd-like character. The problematic part here is that the ‘lies’ are often themselves called ‘lies’ – that is, they are incapable of honesty or ability to will. In contrast, the ‘cheerful’ do alludes to the ‘great announcer’ and introduces us to the concept of cheerfulness. The emphasis of cheerfulness is on the fact that the journey from ignorance to power is a journey that must be able to will. This is courage not in the sense of a straight-forward undertaking, but in the spirit of a overcoming, of which the former is a kind of reward.

Behind the Shield is a subtle but powerful image processing of words. Here, the image of a ‘finger of command’ is used to describe the lack of clear communication of concepts and the fragmentation of culture. The concept is later and still adopted by Herbert concerning Germany.

The image of a bridge is conventional for a few added examples. The span of the mountains is a metaphor for those who are too powerful for their sense of place, and the movement of people is by no means unskilful. Likewise, the symbol of a bridge is associated with the ability to flow (a common symbol is a ‘red herring’). Similarly, the rope is a metaphor for those who are too short a distance away to be counted among the original order. Thus, the dwarf is a ‘sickness’, and the laugholy refers to those who have a fixed (i.e. meticulously cultivated) health system in them. A more ironic meaning is that which ‘fascinates’ than cheerfulness. The idea is that a bridge is an intensification of a fixed alignment, one that ‘transforms’ (in some way or another), and which also allows for the ‘greater good’.

The emphasis of cheerfulness has a long history of philosophy, beginning with Aristotle. In Kant, cheerfulness is a value that the philosopher must declare is illegitimate (i.e. cannot influence the domain of opinions). In truth, cheerfulness is a mode of feeling guilt and a mode of the ascetic ideal. A similar point is made about any number of other values, such as lust, envy, or revenge. However, the ‘gravitational drive’ is a key figure in this, which is thought to be behind the belief in leeching ‘beyond’.

Similarly, what is "cleaner" is a product of the action of deliberation than is "heavy"! That is, the deliberative nature of the will is not it, for example, a question of whether the affirmative duty of the criminal is moral or religious (‘ascetic morality’), or more importantly, whether the good and the bad actions of the moment align. This is a bad sign for the Greek concept of the ‘gathering of birds’, who are gathered to discuss the question of which form of life is most natural and what is most shameful.

The notion of guilt has a long history of philosophy, beginning with Aristotle. In Kant, the bad conscience of the philosopher must be judged in terms of the ‘gravitational pull’. This is a statement in favour of the notion of guilt, which is related to the feeling of guilt and the need to avoid one’s life because of the guilt. Also, guilt is a term of abuse used by moral and religious religious figures to describe those who feel guiltest towards them. It is also used by religious and theological writers to describe those who are ill or who are prone to convalescence. The meaning of the concept of guilt is thoughtfully defined as that which ‘goes to interfere’ in one way or another with the way the overall course of one’s life is, or is capable of affirming itself. Thus, guilt is a crucial virtue, synonymous with peace, agility, strength, and power. It is also associated with projects such as the dream or the beauty of becoming (‘metaphysical way’), and with the eagerness with which one is able to contradict established customs without suffering any consequences.

The devil has three essential meanings. First, the devil is all that is hidden within us, ‘including our best friends and neighbours. Second, the devil is the most persistent serpent in the darkness; this is both because the devil is a hidden symbol that one must be evil to overcome the overcoming of idealism, but also because the overcoming of the sat

 can allow people to live longer and more dynamic lives. Third, the life of contemplation is initially untranslatable or fragmentary, becoming historically reliable and allowing new possibilities for human life.

Atomism is a theory of nature that posits as the ultimate constituent parts of nature small, indivisible particles that move, collide, and combine in space. The argument begins with Democritus and becomes an integral part of Epicureanism.  It is revived in the early modern period as the basis of many philosophical materialisms and mechanistic accounts of physics. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, atomism received a boost because of the success of the science of chemistry, and likewise its role in models of thermodynamics. As a comprehensive account of nature, atomism always had specific weaknesses, such as its difficulty in understanding the action at a distance that is gravity or magnetism, the often wave-like properties of light, and the whiff of metaphysics that hangs around concepts like indivisibility, indestructibility or pure substance.

<|endoftext|>

Atomism has several roots. First, it is from the concept by the eighteenth-century physicist Boscovich - the effect of matter based upon forces – that is, without requiring an underlying positing of matter. Second, a Neo- Kantian (and Schopenhauerian) critique of the nature of matter considered as a large thing-in-itself (i.e. to say, an attack on the notion of permanence). Third, the claim that atoms are a hypostatisation of a specific illegitimate concept of the separability and separate identifiability of cause and effect, which is a psychological concept. Fourth, and closely related, the atom is a projection into the inorganic of a metaphysical conception of the self or soul understood as the subject of its effects or experiences, and initiator of its actions and this conception itself may arise from the linguistic habit. The metaphysical question of whether atoms are real is supplanted by the question of what lies behind the belief in atoms: namely a moral commitment to notions of stability, order, responsibility, and freedom.

Considering Dionysian and Apollonian as primary cultural forms are the work of Bachofen, a Swiss anthropologist and legal historian. Bachofen is a prominent example of the attempt to read mythology as encoded history or anthropology. Bachofen in Mother Right assembled evidence for an original, matriarchal origin of human societies and institutions, one that was superseded by a transitional ‘Dionysian’ stage, and then an entirely patriarchal step that Bachofen called ‘Apollonian’. Apollonian and Dionysian are not the historical stages of culture, but as drives within all cultures.

Barbarism refers to the unintelligible sounds of non- Greek languages and thus effectively meaning ‘non-Greek’. Brutality also means lacking in any authentic culture, mainly where the idea is that such culture has been lost or undone. The history of culture could be written as the turning inwards, onto oneself, of the instincts of domination of the barbarian. The democratic mixing of races and cultures in Europe has led to a ‘semi-barbarism’, but this provides it also with its ‘historical sense’. Every higher culture begins because of the dominance of a ‘barbarian’ class, who are more natural, whole, animal and without impaired instincts.

Beauty is both a narrower and a more comprehensive concept: more restricted, because not all art has been beautiful as its aim or effect; more extensive, because not all that is met as beautiful is art. Beauty plays a role as the healing quality of the Apollonian illusion, which both protects us from but also allows some access to wisdom concerning the true nature of the world. This also means that the primary distinction among aesthetic categories is not between beauty and sublimity (Homeric epic is a relevant category within the Apollonian), but between both together and a third: the Dionysian effect that rightly belongs to music. Beauty is a late innovation, masking the shudder in the presence of the divine.

Beauty has a decisive relationship to knowledge. Nothing is beautiful, but only because it is known; likewise, the origin of beauty may be ugliness coming to an awareness of itself. Because knowledge always involves projection of human values onto its object, and could only be knowledge of being,
