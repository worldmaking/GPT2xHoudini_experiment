 and ‘new age’, it is a way of thinking about values. A world without values is a world without life – and this is a world without the force of will.

There are three aspects to the affirmation. The first and most apparent revolves around those values that involve a denigration or even rejection – either this is part of the human or material ‘end’; the rejection often shows a lack of ‘comfortable truths’. The affirmation can involve a disavowal of all values, either culturally sanctioned or be transformed (by way of a cultural adaptation). Affirmation should not be understood as a new action or responsibility (i.e. one which is directed towards the future of a people). Instead, it is a way of my becoming whole and independent of these values and perspectives. The recognition that not all affirmations are thus democratic is Mansfieldian. Affirmation is not just the acceptance of some views or practices but a recognition that some accepts it. A 'no' becomes a affirmation of onejor vitiating the urge for mores. Affirmation can be positive or a negative, as the feeling of having found a way of affirming an earlier wrong. Affirmation is a way of a life defined for the future, in which case it is loving and guideful of the present. Affirmation is healthy and in someone else.

<|endoftext|>

The second aspect of affirmation is the ability to stick to established beliefs or practices. This is something that the Greek term ‘antiquarian’ insisted upon. The universal acceptance of the divine – and the character of ancient Greek thought – is a crucial source of the affirmation. The recognition that reality is dynamic and prone to change is another essential source of the promise of the future. Affirmation, and the development of the human, is a ‘solution’. Affirmation is a means of keeping alive and righting wrongs done to others. It thus originates in the notion of faith, or as a mode of life long for the higher good. Affirmation is a means of a life that needs to be able to take on all the hopes and disasters of the past and present. Affirmation is healthy and in someone else.

<|endoftext|>

The third aspect is finally, the ‘love of man for the sake of God’. This is true both for the sake of God and also to provide for the building blocks of a stronger future. So, for example, the love of the good so that God wants to make man strong enough to take on the great task of our time. Affirmation is tested by eternal recurrence. Hate is proven to be healthy when it seeks to repress other values. Affirmation is a model of positive persuasion. Only the individual who canenge his or her convictions – and has the strength to remain positive – can teach the world the love of God.

The theme of marriage has two-fold. First, that more general and difficult questions of morality and religion arise, posing specifically and questioning invariable monogamy. Second, that romantic thought stays true to itself, even in reality. Thus, the theme of love remains universalistic, and not just a specific affirmation of human value, but a challenge to the universal. Third, love is habitually encountered and answered by masculine and feminine drives, and thus also in feminine and masculine matrimonial drives. Thus, the theme of love is universalizing, regardless of whether or not these drives are actual or sensuous drives. Because of this sense of freedom, the theme of marriage continues even if the ideal of a new form of life is in the offing.

The love of one’s fate is one aspect of the whole series of eleven key myths and cultural practices that discuss the perils and benefits of pity. Some of the more interesting are the aphorisms and symbols of pity and its relation to culture and the human, and the relation between culture and soul.

On the one hand, then, all humanity is a tragedy and all is growth or development in the last human. On the other hand, there is a necessity (or a fate) at work in human development, particularly in the sphere of life. Thus, the ideal of a new form of life that does not suffer from the defining features of modernity. The ideal of a new future does not require ‘modernity’ to lose its greatness.

<|endoftext|>

On the one hand, then, all human beings are of equal value and equal ability, and this new ideal is possible only if all human beings are of equal ability and power. The democratic mixing of the human and beast of prey into the modern diet is a crucial aspect of

 and more importantly, the philosopher who has reached an ‘immortal’ stage of denigration and finally calculation. Second, the goal here is not ‘criticism’, but ‘the achievement of a higher state’. Third, the goal is not just the destruction of the current form of the human, but also the growth of the human organism as the total being of its creator.

<|endoftext|>

The notion of critique has received a boost following the passing of Heraclitus to be read as an ‘late critic’ of Greek criticism. However, the critique of the notion of death means to critique the waking life itself. Dying is a means of contradicting the dreams of the philosopher. Accordingly, the book is heavily influenced (in English and German) by Schopenhauer and Dante. 

<|endoftext|>

The narrower concept of critique stems primarily from Kant, where it has a specific philosophical meaning. For Kant, ‘critique’ means to investigate the basis of any human ability (e.g. understanding, judgement, reason) to discover both its fundamental, a priori principles and its limits. The laws are what gives that ability its legitimacy, which is to say a guarantee of its value concerning specific goals (e.g. the principles of the understanding make possible knowledge of the natural world); the limits define possible usages of the ability which are illegitimate (e.g. knowledge of a supernatural world).

<|endoftext|>

The concept of critique also inherits some perspective from Kant. For example, it seems to be at stake in his analysis of Socrates – Socrates was incapable of turning the logical drive against itself. N introduces his new, modified sense of critique in discussing University philosophy and its association with the state. Here, he proposes an experimental type of critique. One cannot critique words with words – because of the account of the origin of words as described, for example in ‘On Truth and Lies’ – instead of life supplies the principle, and the possibility of living in accordance with a philosophy is its legitimacy. The philosopher of the future is ‘critic in body and soul’, although this is still, like the sceptic, only part of the comprehensive sense of the philosopher. Also, and again, truth needs an experimental form of critique; this is not the ‘self-critique’ of knowledge (the critique of words with words) but remains within the orbit of the ascetic ideal.

Traditionally, pity or ‘love of the neighbour’ distinguish the human being from the animal or ‘cruel and playful’ nature. More importantly, such moral practices are often themselves cruel or even founded upon cruelty, to the point that cruelty to oneself (asceticism) is accounted a virtue. This point is made concerning the reactive values of Christian thought. This artificial contrast between human and nature leads the emphasis on the role of cruelty in human affairs. Cruelty is one of the oldest festive joys of humanity, and we deceive ourselves if we think this has been left behind. Instead, every smallest step in the field of free thought involves cruelty towards oneself. And, cruelty now refines itself. More generally still, life means being cruel toward anything that is growing weak and old in us; likewise, greatness implies the ability to inflict great pain. In other words, cruelty is necessary for life; but not all cruelty – specifically, the cruelty often found in moral practices as ‘anti-life’.

<|endoftext|>

Zarathustra calls humans ‘the cruellest beast’ and brings together several forms of cruelty: the pleasure at the suffering of others, the desire involved in the ascetic denigration of life and the cruelty in self-overcoming. The final item on this list certainly includes the cruelty to one’s intellectual conscience engaged in the pursuit of knowledge. The point is elaborated: having internalized existing values and traditions, the philosopher (discoverer of knowledge or creator of values) must be first cruel against him or herself. All these forms of cruelty, from the passive to the reactive, and on to the most active and internal, bring with them a feeling of power. These types of cruelty return more explicitly as the three stages of ‘religious cruelty’, culminating in nihilism – the sacrifice of God ‘for nothing’. Importantly, though, it is more obvious that by pursuing such cruelty to its conclusion that an ‘opposite ideal’ can reveal itself: namely, that form of human beings who can joyously affirm his or her existence.

‘Culture’ means a form of life that people has set up for itself. This culture encapsulates their values, is what allows people both to have

 and without the need to revalue.

There are three critical aspects to the conception about death. The first and most apparent revolves around those values or beliefs that involve a denigration or even rejection of life – either this life (as opposed to the ‘afterlife’) or aspects associated with the living body (sex, passion, pleasure, etc.). A key passage in this regard would be Zarathustra on the ‘preachers of death’. The rejection of life on the part of the ascetic priest is only clear; such asceticism is a means to carry on living despite suffering and degeneration. A different take is embodied in the ‘On the Socratic’, which makes clear that rejecting the life of the real is a rejection of the will to power. A related idea is a danger that the philosopher will meet in his or her attempt to overcome values. The death of the tight-rope walker, who made danger his ‘vocation’, is an example. Finally, metaphysics will often involve a conceptual rejection of becoming or a positing of facts and values as eternal. This is often described with metaphors of death: for example, the ‘mummified concepts.

<|endoftext|>

The ‘death of God’ is the second thought, then three. Finally, metaphysics begins with the discovery of eternal life – that is, a life that cannot be washed or changed. Affirmation, that is a new, much more natural, world. That is, a world without becoming is an age of becoming. Affirmation is already a ‘monster world’, and it can be created again as a ‘god world’.

<|endoftext|>

The third concerns are either the notion of euthanasia or the relation of life to the thought of mortality. Some of the most beautiful passages are pleas for a ‘rational’ or ‘free’ death, one that precisely from out of ‘love of life’ does not allow the body entirely to outlive its usefulness and capacity for action. The thought of death should mix a drop of ‘foolishness’ into life, rather than gloom; this is partly because, without the need to come rapidly to a judgement about the significant issues for the sake of one’s eternal soul, the thought of our mortality frees us to have time for experimentation, and even for mistakes. Individuals should have more reasons to focus on life and joy in life rather than death.

The term of decadence with similar meanings include 'degeneration' and 'corruption'. 'Decadent' was a term of abuse used by French neo-classical or conservative critics against the romanticism of painters like Delacroix or novelists such as Hugo. Later, writers like Baudelaire adopted the term as their own, using it to express scepticism towards many dominant moral or political values. The usage of the word 'decadence' late in the late nineteenth centuries has represented the concepts of corruption, decline or degeneration date. Baudelaire is termed 'a typical decadency', and all references to him associate him with Wagner (Baudelaire was one of Wagner's champions in France). So, the meaning of 'decadence' is any period of cultural history – or any state of the human organism – which has lost its good taste and value judgement  (thus it is associated with pity; with Kantian duty; with Schopenhauer's quieting of the will), health and sureness of instinct, discipline and sense of a future. It is to be associated either with the decline of old cultures or with moral revolutions.

The Kantian and Platonic-Christian metaphysical distinction between appearance and ‘true world’ is termed a ‘sign of decadence’. For all these reasons at Christianity is called a ‘monster of decadence’. Decadent cultures are exhausted cultures, and such cultures often exhibit a pathological over-sensitivity; indeed, often an inability not to respond; degeneration is a sign of a more difficult and more difficult to grasp sense of meaning. Decadent cultures can be aarthen, or just a people with a bad conscience. There has a distinguish between a general and a specific sense of decadence, and this is a sense that has been lost in modernity. general 'end', therefore, is defined not only with 'prehistory' but also with ‘all’ ‘future'. The decadent culture of the late nineteenth century was a watershed moment for science, language and philosophy. It is represented by biologists writing about the growth of the human into the modern: from a primitive, slave-like class, to a class
