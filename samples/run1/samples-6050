This notion of affirmation is linked to enervation and thus to the concept of blood. Blood is thought of as a narcotic that our appetites are the mechanism by which we communicate and are delivered to our psychological vocation as the subject of its effects or experiences, and as a means of overcoming one's overcoming.

The emphasis of affirmation is on the observation that many aspects of the above description may be true or at least interesting observations. However, the widespread acceptance of the concept of affirmation should be understood as a proclamation of the direction of all science and modernity. In the absence of a transcendent or phenomenal creator, the concept of affirmation must be a turning off, a turning away from the actual in the above sense of 'to dryness', and a turning now back to the actual. This is a kind of a Cronenberg effect: more specifically, the Dionysian ideal is a godending of human or animal will to power. Thus, all our affirmations are in contradiction here, bringing to mind the Apollonian command and its effects on Greek cultural life.

A third aspect of the concept of affirmation is seemeth to pledge. This is a recognisable and relevant image to the first, above. This means both that affirmation is a specifying of kinds of great things; also, the nature of mere appearance. a ‘declaration of the desert’, thus, is not something to be ashamed of. To the desert, the noble person is a ‘dictator’ – that is, the expression of an idea that has no basis other than its existence. The democratic mixing of cultures may well be the genesis of the notion of a ‘dictator’. Second, the expression ‘despising’ means to reject the notion of a thing or an effectual form. An effect is, in a sense, a culture. But, an ‘actor in literature is ‘a deriving ‘evil from among us’. Third, there are some texts ‘highly critical’ of the notion of a god’, which are read as ‘a denigration of the transcendent,’ of the positive and of the negative, but also of the ancient and modern cultural drives for the creation of gods and goddesses. The denigration of the real is a ‘cruel and cynical’ view of the value of the real, and a part of the reason for this is that the a priori principle is a model of liberal values. Regarding the costs, this is a case of a culture struggling against itself and overcoming itself. The struggle for power is a disaster which only culture can rebuild.

The third strand of thought concerning the nature of allegory is the notion of allegory. In particular, the playwright must be able to reach out and influence the thoughts of the readers. This is a concept without a single term to name it.  The playwright, as far as he or she is an actor, has no place in metaphysics, history, philosophy, metaphysics, physics, or theology. On the other hand, there is a clear distinction between an allegorical and a non- allegorical relationship: the non- ‘lying" is often allegorical in character and love of fate, while the clever" is often clever in heart and soul. 

<|endoftext|>

The fourth strand concerns the notion of logos: the philosopher must be able to look away from the real, stripped of any metaphysical additions and effects and values. This is a simplified version of the question: can ‘scholarly’ faith be upheld in a world without values? The logic of logic is that a society needs to be able to support itself while preserving its stability. So, there is no real question of restoring or updating values, but merely a question of restoring some or all of the stability. This is socialism at its best. But, what is needed is not a revolution but a reformation, a revaluation of the productive forces at work. This is a challenging and revealing ideal.

The text of the Apollonian is ‘varying opinions’, and this amounts to a questioner in a sense of a ‘finger-piece’, to be sure. More generally, the primary condition of communication is the sharing of a language – a system of signs and significations. But, what is signified is by no means either ‘raw’ (i.e. uninterpreted) experiences or things in the world; somewhat, these significations are changed by values. Therefore, meaning ‘ater’ is considered as a different

The devil has three primary meanings. First, it is common fears and traditional conceptions of evil. Second, the devil may be certain temptations, through which one might deviate from or be held down from one’s path of growth. Zarathustra’s devil is the ‘spirit of gravity’, while the sorcerers is ‘spirit of melancholy’ (gravity and melancholy are both variations on the word ‘Schwarz’ which means ‘heavy’). Third, the devil indicates the interconnection of the good and the bad, the positive and negative (i.e. the notion that opposites are not opposite). Thus, the devil is just God’s leisure every seventh day.

Although in philosophical history the notion of dialectic has other reference points than this (Kant and Hegel, particularly), the use of the term here is exclusively about Socrates (and by extension Plato).

What one habitually eats, and drinks has a relationship to one’s spiritual life – that is, on what we think and how we value. The traditional diets of various nations, the religious practice of fasting or the role of beer in German culture are ample proof. More generally, this is part of the concern with the ‘closest things’: the spiritual significance of the patterns of life that are usually overlooked by philosophers on the hunt of ‘big’ issues. The interesting part in diet is that it has a metaphorical counterpoint in the idea of ‘incorporation’: the way the will to power absorbs, digests, makes its other powers, values, or ideas.

<|endoftext|>

Digestion has several meanings. First, philosophers have always chased after the significant issues and ignored the closest things, such as the food we eat. His discussions of digestion, intestines or stomachs are thus meant to be suggestions as to how certain daily life practices affect the spiritual domain of beliefs and ideas. Second, digestion is a metaphor for the ability of an individual or group to live with specific facts or conditions, which is about those who find life indigestible and therefore want its end.

<|endoftext|>

Similarly, human beings in the modern period are called homo pemphigus because they can consume everything, indiscriminately, without benefit and decision. In contrast, the ‘coming philosophers will have ‘teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible’, meaning will be able to deal with – and indeed form a new mode of life out of – dangerous truths. Excrement, the product of digestion, is a strong metaphor also. Pessimists only view the world’s ‘backside’. Writing is, therefore, a necessity, like having to relieve oneself – which is a joking elaboration of the idea that ‘my writings speak only of my overcoming’. Third, to consume or digest means to make something one’s own, and thereby have power over something.

Dionysius is a Greek deity. It is employed with many features of the myths and cultural practices associated with Dionysus, either as anthropological reference points, or as symbols: the association with grapevines, wine and intoxication; the association both with harvest and with spring, and thus both with plenty and with sexuality; the fact that the tragedy and comedy competition was held at a festival to Dionysus; that Dionysus’ mortal mother made Zeus reveal his full divinity, and was killed by Zeus’ lightning; that as a child he was hidden and protected in a cave by nymphs; that, in some tales, he is torn apart but then reborn; that Dionysus marries Ariadne, after she was abandoned by Theseus; that he is represented both as kind and generous, though also cruel to his enemies; his association with lions and dolphins, as well as minor mythic creatures such as satyrs or nymphs; the reported savagely destructive behaviour of devotees during certain religious rites; and in general the association of Dionysus with joy and with release from labour or care.

The Dionysian is one of the three cultural drives in The Birth of Tragedy, along with the Apollonian and Socratic. The Dionysian is there associated with intoxication, ecstasy (being- outside-of-oneself), and thus with cultural productions such as lyric poetry and many aspects of music (especially harmony).  This artistic drive implicitly has a metaphysics (i.e. a way of understanding the nature of reality). The coming together of Dionysian and Apollonian drives into a singular cultural production is the

Butterfly is a vital image with far-reaching but not always clear implications. Broadly, the image of butterfly is in a negative, though also in a positive way. The critical meaning of the former is thoughtless living in and for the present. Butterfly is thus modern humanity with its newspapers and petty politics. There are two aspects to the positive meaning. First, the butterfly is childlike, innocent, and therefore able to relate to its world without the heaviness of values. Second, the butterfly is a standard mode of existence, lightly and laughingly affirming of its conditions and its fate. The butterfly, in this sense, is also eager for growth. The butterfly is used in this sense, but now with an emphasis on the problematic sacrifices that are the precondition of such growth. The idea of cocoon is about the Apollonian cultural drive being forced to disguise itself as mania for persuasion, but re-emerging in modernity.

Caesar is a Roman general, politician and then ‘dictator’ of Rome. To mention Caesar and Napoleon together metaphorize instances of something exceptionally free, characterised by scepticism and the throwing off faiths, a moment of beauty and genius. Caesar, the tyrant, is thus also an example of the opportunities and dangers of decadence, for the highest type is always ‘five paces from tyranny’. It is precisely that danger which is their condition of growth.

'Camel' is the first of the three 'transformations of the spirit'. Importantly, the spirit as camel is already a transformation, and not a default position of the human. The camel wishes the bear as heavy a burden as possible, to feel its strength and test that strength. The weights are those of the deliberate assumption of humility and self-mockery, confining oneself to a specialization, discovering dangerous or unpleasant truths, rejecting the pity of others, and overcoming one's overcoming (i.e. departing a cause when it is victorious). In other words, the camel is the free spirit as far as he or she recognizes these states as burdens; exhibits veneration towards the burdens, that interprets them as valuable; and, knows him or herself to be strong enough to bear them.

The Case of Wagner was written early in 1888, which tries to assess both Wagner’s career, contribution and more importantly, the significance and danger of his decadence.

The images of cat relate to the cat family from domestic cats to tigers and lions. The lion stands for exceptional strength, ravenous desire, strong will to power, but is primarily destructive and only prefiguring creation. The figure of the lion is an echo of Plato’s analogy, where the lion stands for the thump’s element of the soul and spiritedness. The lion figures prominently hint the sign that the days of loneliness are over. Also, the symbol of lions is as combining power with gentleness.

The tiger is one of the animals associated in mythology with Dionysus, which explicitly refers to fat. The tiger’s wildness is not tamed by, but directly not opposed to Dionysus’ needs or purposes. As one lush growth of the tropical south, the tiger is a symbol of wanton and sudden destructiveness (always about to leap) and over-abundance (‘Homer’s Contest’). Thus, also the tiger is the figure of that sudden urge to traitorous injustice among the Greeks, which requires the state to keep it in check. This tension can be seen negatively as unresolved, lacking perfection or direction. The ‘higher men’ are compared to a tiger that has failed in its leap – that is, ashamed of their action, and not accepting the role of chance in the growth of the human.

In general, the cat is an incompletely domesticated animal that it appears peaceful, loves comfort, but has a residual wildness, remains akin to a beast of prey and is mischievous or wilful. Also, the clouds are implied to cats, incapable of decision; and, cats are also compared with the figure of a woman. However, the cat is incapable of giving, reciprocity or love. In this, it is the opposite of the dog—moreover, the images of granite statues of cats, standing for old-fashioned values, heavy and unmovable.

The notion of ‘category’ has a long history of philosophy, beginning with Aristotle. In Kant, the categories form a set of 12 essential and a priori concepts under which all experience falls.
