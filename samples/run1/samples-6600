Third, it is about the positive contribution that Christianity – despite its explicit aims – has had. Christianity involves a powerful cultural drive to produce greatness in the form of the saint (although its association with the modern state corrupted this). Similarly, Christianity provided human beauty and refinement. In France, the Christian realized itself as the supreme human being – and thus also this is the place where high free spirits could arise since they needed ‘perfect opponents. Christianity has taught us moral scepticism. Christianity rescued the ancient world from its decadency, and in some way preserved it. Christian practices, including especially the ascetic, have produced an agile intellect capable of understanding perspective. Likewise, Christian values and institutions can now be understood as tools for the advantage of the higher nobility.

The notion of the impotence of 'City' can be found in 'antiquarian' history, which is associated with cities. Such account at best serves life only as preservation and not creation but, at worst, 'mummifies' life. The city is also associated with the 'mob'. It is thus a place where wisdom is all but impossible. Therefore, calling for a revision of the standard architecture of large cities to ensure 'places for reflection' is quite vital. The city becomes a metaphor for a desire to depict, even in art, the ugly side of life.

The terms ‘classes’ or ‘castes’ mean recognised and persistent differences between whole sections of a society in terms of political, economic, or social value and power, and attendant behaviours. There are two broad ways of analysing class: either it arises because of external circumstance, or because of intrinsic nature. Liberals and socialists tend to take the former view: in themselves, all human beings are of equal value and equal ability, but historical accidents left one group with certain privileges and characteristics. In socialism, this situation is considered unjust and is to be set right through revolution. The key figures here are Marx and Engels. For liberalism, the given case may be regarded as acceptable provided reforms yield ‘equality of opportunity’. Essential historical data here are Hobbes, Rousseau, and Mill. As far as the Reformation involved criticism of the grip of the priestly class over the religious life of all humans, who are in themselves equal before God, then Luther too should be mentioned. The intrinsic view, on the other hand, claims that there are real differences between individuals and groups, and these mean that the existing class order is broadly natural and beneficial. These differences may be supposed to have arisen historically, biologically or be divinely sanctioned, among other explanations. Key figures would include Burke and Carlyle, as well as Catholic defenders of the church hierarchy.

The two elements of which modernity is most proud are incompatible. Science and culture require a ‘scholarly’ or ‘aristocratic’ class which has leisure. This leisure can only arise at the expense of a ‘slave’ class, and this is in direct contradiction of the dominant modern belief in liberal values of equality and democracy. Thus, the function of a class is not ossified, and the working classes also offer the greatest hope for the formation of a genuine people. 

<|endoftext|>

Both biological types and historical circumstances are temporary instruments available to a people – and behind anyone else, life itself – to further those ends necessary to the people or life. These ends include survival, no doubt, but more importantly, the enhancement and expression of power. A class system is, then, for as long as it serves these ends – regardless of how those values or purposes are developed or interpreted as a whole. Historically, from out of these hierarchies, moral values and religious ideals were to be developed into a ‘pyramid’ class. Now, these differences may or may not be classically expressed, but the overall shape of a class is. This is manifested in the way that the higher and more powerful are called ‘rabble’, and the lower classes are called ‘slave’. While class is initially the group-consciousness of a people, it becomes progressively more and more pervasive as the context in which higher culture is focused. This is manifested in the way that many of the concepts of class are derived from Greek mythology, either as absolute concepts or as a function of the historical conditions.

Although anarchism appears to be intellectually opposed to other modern ideas such as democracy, equality or even socialism, is in fact of a piece with them. Anarchism is founded on reaction and ressentiment, remains moralistic, expresses a fundamental belief in the value of pity, or instead a fundamental inability not to feel shame, and finally evidences a desire for the herd

The most famous usage of the ‘allegory of death’ is in the passing word ‘of things’ to come. This is a typical habit of the barbarian or Roman leaders, either because they are too cowardly to take risks related to food or supply needed healing, or because they are too cowardly to think of anything coming their way. It is the product of a culture that has become too animal-like and bred down. The domestication of the animal led to a ‘terrible beast’, the notion of domestication being revalued as a healthy form of human life. It is repeated that animal is a metaphor for the decadence of the barbarian, who has dominated culture since the death of the original Hesiod.

Barrel organ is a mechanical musical instrument and performs as a metaphor: music, repetition and without soul, is a culture without life, or something merely repeat without genuine understanding.

There are three essential ideas. First, the observation that no culture, no epoch, is void of life or activity. The earth as a whole is a total stimulation, without life. The atomists (including the Epicureans) say that life is the basis of all cultures, and the development of the human is an excellent example. Second, it is the concept of culture that has the sanction of science; indeed, all cultural practice is a culture of life and a universalisation of culture. Third, it is the concept of culture that has survived Schopenhauer for more than a thousand years. Cultural advances depend upon power differences and the ‘pathos of distance’; in turn, this means that culture is a ‘pyramid’ with a broad base of workers. Pyramids are also the place where Greek and Roman cultural life has aligned. Sixth, there are several incomplete attempts from the mid-1880s on to produce a metaphysical argument that relates the concept of ‘eternal din’ to eternal recurrence. The argument involves a distinction between two senses of culture, namely: (i) the cultural drive to produce value; and (ii) the more subtle and metaphysically subtle, the drive to make culture and its values appear. Here, culture is seen as the mechanism by which a method is transferred from principle to effect, and this brings us to the third reason for the emphasis on culture: the internalisation of culture.

<|endoftext|>

The notion of culture is not, as one might have expected, primarily in the context of a discussion of concepts such as ‘class’ or ‘rank’. A key passage in this regard would be Zarathustra on the ‘specialization’ of the barbarian. The conventional wisdom is that this is a symptom of a weak and defensive culture, and this is counter-productive. In turn, this is a form of asceticism that seeks to repress and even destroy culture. However, this repressed culture cannot be undone; instead, the barbarian is a ‘role’ – that is, a contribution made to the overall health and growth of the barbarian. This is a way of thinking about the development of values. The role of culture is not, as one might have expected, primarily in the context of a discussion of concepts such as ‘sex, marriage, or inheritance’. Instead, the significant contribution that culture has taken is beyond the traditional class system: into the realm of ideas and practices that are traditionally associated with that system, such as the right to form a class. This kind of culture is not, as one might have expected, primarily in the context of a discussion of concepts such as ‘marriage’. Instead, the interesting part in culture is the way that culture forms and the ways that the will to power functions within the system. This kind of culture is already present in many aspects of human life, from religious to practical.

Similarly, this account of the body explains the association of sexuality with amor fate. Both are expressions of an idea that is based on an incompletely realised human being: the diseased must be transformed, to make way for the health of the system.

The third strand of thought concerning culture is the notion of sublimation, in which a symbolic contract is had between a belief in a future or retribution and a belief in a future afterlife. The former could be understood as a human-created cultural phenomenon, the latter a metaphysical thought experiment. In either case, the latter is a way of thinking about concepts such as ‘opposite ends’ – the metaphysical questioner is asked to imagine a world in which the beliefs and practices of the times are based on

A belief in the independence of substance is a theme of Kant. The account of the notion of suspension of duty is especially successful, in the belief that this account of duty will lead to a recognition of the real as oneruly whole, and not as a class. Manduca and Weil attempt to revalue the relation of duty to the whole of culture, particularly in the context of the modern state. Duty is defined as the 'conditions' of a people ('the real's') and a state ('the real') – and is thus defined at all. The dispersion of power and responsibility is countered by the robust notion of the will to power, and the idea of the individual self or soul as the mode of existence. As for the role of faith in modernity, this function may be reciprocally funded.

The notion of ‘prehistory’ has a long history of analysis and interpretation, beginning with Darwin (the theory of the evolution of species). It has extended to be True Human, especially in its association with the concept of ‘formula For Growth’. In its inversion of the previous statement that history is a ‘camel case’,  this notion of having to be the last to lose it's way and rapidly becoming what it is (evenhandedness is an aspect of greatness).

Digestion has several roots. First, philosophical knowledge is understood as the becoming aware and taking charge of something; likewise, the last thing one needs to be a slave to be an  excellent conscience. Second, digestion is the taking charge of any future’s forgetting, and the process of self-overcoming.

<|endoftext|>

Digestion also happens to be a reference to the chewing of, say, the internal structure of the stomach (BB) before it even has a chance to develop. In digestion, digestion becomes a certain way of thinking about the nature of the real, and the sense of perspective that opinion has in relation to facts. That is, digestion sets out a new, more natural, course of life. The addition of digestion to the standard evolutionary account of health and growth is a watershed moment of great danger and promise. The change in diet is felt both by the author and by readers.

Cheerfulness, most often, but the concept shades into other words that might otherwise be interpreted as happiness or joyfulness. Optimism cannot be a consequence of a lack of awareness of pain, cruelty or destructiveness – because this was the people that invented tragedy and celebrated the wisdom of Silenus – nor could it be a consequence of ‘unendangered ease and comfort’, or pure sensuality, because then philosophy would never have arisen. Instead, this cheerfulness or serenity arises because of the healing effects of Apollonian beauty. Because on its terms the immersion into the Dionysian is experienced as ‘the eternal lust and delight of existence’. That is to say, the Greeks were much more aware of the true nature of existence than we moderns but had developed a culture in which reality is justified as an aesthetic phenomenon. This degenerates after the death of tragedy into the ‘cheerfulness of slaves’ without responsibility.

<|endoftext|>

There are three meanings in cheerfulness. First, cheerfulness as blissful ignorance; second, cheerfulness as a disguise, a way of appearing to be different from, and be misunderstood by, others. Third, and most importantly, cheerfulness is part of the ideal of a new form of life that does not suffer from the defining features of modernity. This last idea is, in part, an updating of the Apollonian concept; in part, it is a new analysis of the perils of an over-historicized culture (see historical sense). Cheerfulness is thought of as an effect of the exercise of power, or of one who shows an excess of strength. Likewise, it is a characteristic of someone who has found their proper element, the role most aligned to their character. Thus, the highest human beings of the present will be both ‘cheerful’ and ‘live dangerously’. Taking the questioning of morality seriously has, as a kind of reward, cheerfulness – or the ‘gay science’. In other words, there is a stage of nausea or nihilism in the confrontation with the genealogy of values, but this stage overcomes itself in cheerfulness. The significance of cheerfulness considers
