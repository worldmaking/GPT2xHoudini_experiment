 terms from 'modern ideas' that are about limitations and limitations of human possibilities. In contrast, the ‘coming philosophers will have ‘teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible’, meaning will be able to deal with – and indeed form a new mode of life out of – dangerous truths. Excrement, the product of digestion, is a strong metaphor also. Pessimists only view the present ‘world’ as ‘full of actors’, meaning the possibilities are vast. Benevolence is a ‘historical sense’. Destruction is a poetic device like no other. The mention of biblical events and the manner in which they occur to readers.

The primary condition of communication is the sharing of a language – a system of signs and significations. But what is signified is by no means either ‘raw’ (i.e. uninterpreted) experiences or things in the world; somewhat, these significations are changed by values. Therefore, having a language in common is dependent upon also sharing a set of values. It follows that communication of thoughts that depend upon a new set of values, or those values themselves, is the most difficult. Moreover, one’s values are a product of one’s constitution – for example, various inheritances from the past, including both cultural and genetic, the habits that form a mode of life, etc. So, to communicate genuinely new thoughts or values would be to transform the listener. There is the same problem with interpreting or understanding ancient cultures. Particularly to the ancient Greeks,  there is an aloneness that is difficult and perhaps impossible to bridge (‘Homer’s Contest’); alternatively, if it can be bridged, would result in a transformation of the present – this, for example, is the reason which gets repeatedly emphasised the Greek sense of religion.

This ‘pessimistic’ view of language is not the final word, however. That which is noble will have both a need and even an ability to communicate singular values ‘to men and things. Notice in these passages that the idea is expressed in terms of an overflowing of fullness. There is an echo in that passage of Kant’s notion of genius as having (among other things) the ability to hit upon a communicative vehicle for an idea that, in different ways, is inexpressible. This idea in saying that the purpose of style is to communicate states –  ‘I was the first to discover the great rhythm, the great style of the period’.

The concept of mythic symbols represents the mechanism by which culture might be unified, and thus share the basis for communication concerning that which is genuinely significant. Also, concepts of metaphor, symbol, and allegory as mechanisms by which communication might be able to surpass its built-in limits. So, for example, the ‘man of intuition’ discussed at the end of ‘Truth and Lies’ occupies a world where things are liberated from their bondage under functional needs and accompanying values. Furthermore, the concept of Dionysian can also be considered through this fashion. This ‘inspired’ state is thus key to the noble attempt to communicate to and transform others. However, the free spirit sometimes needs to avoid communication even to his or her closest friends, either to protect the self and its ideals or them.

"God is such a bad communicator" - the joke at the expense of religious controversy, which was often over points of interpretation, and the recently developed science of biblical hermeneutics, the purpose of which was to apply the rigorous methods of philology and history to sacred texts. Such lousy communication leads to scepticism and atheism; it, thus, drives to the death of God.

Comprehensiveness is a concept without a single term to name it. Comprehensiveness describes an individual who encompasses and can employ a variety of different states, drives or types of knowledge. Thus, comprehensiveness stands especially in contrast to the specialization typical of modern intellectual life. It is related to the idea of the multiple (the human soul is various), and to the wanderer who has no fixed cultural home and sees and takes part in much. Comprehensiveness also describes the various abilities, all separately developed in human prehistory, that needed to come together to make the thinker. Analogously, it either links to the emergence of the comprehensive ‘individual’ who can live ‘beyond’ the morality of some old, decaying culture. The philosopher must be able to see with many eyes, to view things from many perspectives; to develop this ability of  ‘brief habits’—similarly, the ability to function concerning both

 terms as such.

Furthermore, many effects that have traditionally been devalued (such as lust or envy) are nevertheless not merely necessary aspects of cultures, but even essential conditions of them. A similar point is made about even the ‘rabble’. The highest form of life would likely be one that has the strength to remain devoted to the ascending movement of life, regardless of conditions. The theory of the all-determining effects of milieu (a sociological concept prominent in nineteenth-century France) in favour of an account of successful or unsuccessful adaptation, where ‘adaptation’ may mean wearing a mask to appear adapted, is unacceptable. Conditions become not irrelevant but interpreted and affirmed as precisely what was needed for this ascent to happen. Zarathustra, who has sought to declare the whole course of life in it becoming up to and through himself, says ‘The time has flowed past when accidents could still befall me’.

Conscience is one's sense that what one is doing is the 'right' or 'wrong' thing; the concept applies whatever the sphere of action is (intellectual, practical, moral) and whatever standard of right or wrong is relevant. For example, despite temptations, the rigorous seeker after truth cannot return to romanticism or Christianity without 'dirtying' his or her intellectual conscience. Conscience can be individual, or some group can act as the conscience of an age. Not surprisingly, conscience is often associated with honesty. The idea seems to be that a good conscience is the alignment of the maxims of one's action with the growth of higher culture, of the feeling of power or the human type. This notion of conscience is an old-fashioned one.

To not adopt a questioning attitude, especially to moral questions, to not even be interested, proves neither an excellent nor lousy conscience but a lack of conscience. Here is an example of a lack of conscience that the play-actor only believes in what he can convince others of. His or her beliefs are thus reactive, and changeable depending upon the audience. We are too 'comfortable' to have respeccable intellectual systems, and therefore happily chop and change our views. We are incapable even of hypocrisy or bad intellectual conscience. If a conscience at all, the philosopher who looks to find reasons for what he or she already believes would have an evil conscience.

<|endoftext|>

It is possible for conscience to be corrupted. For example, through a morality of custom, creativity buys a bad conscience – that is to say, the conscience of the social group has been internalized. Similarly, habits of obedience in a people can lead to even the commanders having a bad conscience at having to command, and masking this by pretending to follow still higher rules. The opposite movement, namely the acquisition of the ability to contradict established customs with a good conscience. Thus, the concept of the ‘intellectual conscience’, defined as the ‘conscience behind your “conscience”’, and which is precisely the ability to question one’s habits, and the customs or beliefs of one’s age.

The most sustained treatment of the theme of the genesis of conscience is presented in the Treatise of GM - that the aim here is to explore the sovereign individual, with ‘power over oneself and fate’. This idea of having a ‘long, unbreakable will’ relates to the frequent criticism of bad conscience in the sense of regretting an. But this is a ‘late’ fruit, and much of the treatise concerns preliminary stages: the breeding of the concepts of guilt and punishment from out of the debt of legal subjects and the cruelty involved in the redemption of debt. Bad conscience is initially the state of the higher human being – one who has lost his or her footing in the real, and is trying to be reborn as one. It is defined as a directing against oneself of these higher instincts and desires; it is a hatred of the self or self-overcoming. Here it is not the result of an internalization of external values, but a ressentiment to one side. That is, resentment against one’s self can be externalized to it. Bad conscience is tested by religious fervour and its result is veneration. Here it is not the result of an internalization of external values, but a rigorous renunciation of them. In fact, this is how Dionysius first becomes aware of the contradiction in terms: on the one hand, the ideal is a test of the will to power, and on the other hand, all our actions are of a nature’s internal ressentiment. Here are some of the central ideas of the Treatise: the attempt to revalue threaten

Animal defers to tier, and with different connotations, Bestie. In general, it is the figure of animality to describe aspects of the human, for example, virtues, vices, drives or types. Sometimes, however, there will be a unique twist or inversion of meanings or values.

<|endoftext|>

However, 'animal' does not only indicate about types of animals but animality more generally. First, 'animal' stands for a conception of humanity that tries to reintegrate the human into the broader natural world. The human has been falsely differentiated. It was countered with an 'honest', even scientific, characterisation of the human-animal. Second, 'animal' is the figure of that creature guided by instinct rather than by reason or conscious deliberation, and thus also whose abilities may be healthy rather than repressed or distorted through domestication or guilt before God. Third, the animal can mean that aspect of the human which does or should cause shame, which has not reached to that type of nobility that is distinctively human.

Finally, the animal kingdom is one where differences (such as those along the food chain) inhibit or at least delay the growth of new types of life. The kingdomwide chain is thus an 'Agile' system, one that affirms all the various ways in which the survival of the human (and later beast) is linked to the growth of other human types. This idea is discussed at the end of the book when it is deemed appropriate. Myagliano is a commonly used image.

The notion of the beast of prey is a common one. Also, prey is a crucial analogy for other human types, notably the animal or the human-animal, and also includes the lion. Both are dynamic and influential cultural figures, and thus both are influential also in terms of the development of the human. Moreover, both are beast-like in their destructive and healing aspects, and also in their gentleness and peace of will. The beast is that which is soft and protective of the human, and which is strong and self-overcoming. The beast is also capacity for self-overcoming. The two figures thus overlap, and thus there is an image of the beast in Hindu culture. The beast is the (highly compressed) concept of the Hinduvik (Hindusuvius) who tempts the human towards self-overcoming. The beast is also the (late) ‘hero’ of science and rational thought, who tempts the human towards the ‘great idea’. The beast is also the (late) ‘god of beasts’ and thus thereby thus is both a metaphor for both the need for the separation of the human from the beast and the need for the creation of new things. The beast is also the (late) ‘god of childbirth’ and thus thus also both a metaphor for the creation of a new world order concerned primarily with the mother and newborn. The feminine and masculine become alternately Shiva (ティ�女老宙), Asha (老夜), and asadmi (ためん). The Dionysian is thus both a setting and a feeling – and this is unlike the dream in which we are aware of the beyond world and begin to analyse and contemplate it. The dream is another example of an awareness that the world is ‘my activity’ and does not belong to me. The dream is a state of mind that includes but is not limited to ‘feeling’. Thus, the dream is not merely an inability to view things from the vantage point of a dream, but also to ‘feeling’ oneself, to say ‘the’s’self’. This is especially true of the dream state in which there is an immediate illusion of reality, one that things are understood as being real, and thus not only that, but also that things are understood as being the way. Here, the dream is not only an inability to view things from the perspective of a ‘feeling’, but also to view things the way. This is both a dreaming creature who is aware of herself as an ‘object of perception’ but also who is aware of being an ‘soul’. Thus, the dream is that the waking philosopher who has set herself against the will will will to the point that she will abandon the way and become ‘a dreaming human being’.

Dühring is a German realist or materialist philosopher, who represents an attempt to revalue morally rejected effects, and he usually uses the term ressentiment to analyse the concept of justice.
