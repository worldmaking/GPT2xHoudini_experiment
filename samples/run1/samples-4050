 pairs of the human, an ideal for which ‘human’ has no future, no home, and no family. Third, to believe in an impossible or metaphysical ideal, to pity or ‘love-at-life’. This last idea is, in part, an updating of the Apollonian concept; in part, it is a new analysis of the perils of an over-historicized culture (see historical sense). Cheerfulness is thought of as an effect of the exercise of power, or of one who shows an excess of strength. Likewise, it is a characteristic of someone who has found their proper element, the role most aligned to their character. Thus, the highest human beings of the present will be both ‘cheerful’ and ‘live dangerously’. Taking this theme as a whole, here cheerfulness is not a stable entity but a multiplicity, with individual and collective characteristics. As a whole, the human is an animal pitted against one ‘cone of granite’ – the role of culture and executive power in human affairs; in turn, this means that the higher human beings are a stone cold maniac; and in turn, this means that the volcano is a ‘monster of a culture’.

The idea of culture is both aDIETARY and AGRICULTURAL; thus, the former is also an ATOMICALLY Greek concept. Culture creates artists, theorists, philosophers, the religious philosopher or religious personages who can teach the sick how to live with science and produce genius or genius; the latter is a set of practices or institutions that in turn create or keep human life dynamic and healthy; in both, culture is a way of life or soul that is dynamic and potent, and not just a certain inarticulate ignorance that is both a disordered space but also a vast and dynamic body of consciousness.

<|endoftext|>

The concept of culture can be used broadly, to designate cultural forms that span dozens of nations and hundreds of years (e.g. ‘Alexandrian’ or ‘Hellenic’); or narrowly, to discuss individual peoples or sub-groups (such as ‘noble culture’ ). Culture is a way of diverting the course of one’s life onto the right path, the path that leads to another world or after-life. Also, culture is a tool being used by a specific people (e.g. a genius or wickedness), and thus also serves as a metaphor for how that people is used by the culture designer to make their world as beautiful and healthy as possible.

<|endoftext|>

The concept of culture can be used expansively, to designate specific forms of culture, and even to discuss individual peoples or sub-groups (such as ‘noble culture’ ). Also, culture is individual, and each has its own context and function.

<|endoftext|>

The concept of culture can be used in two senses. First, culture isstream activity taking place concerning concepts, values, or practices. Second, culture is a collection of processes or individuals, who are in themselves responsible for one’s culture. This idea is related to N’s 'progress’;  and is also related to the ‘spirit of culture’. Third, culture is a culture of ideas, beliefs, values, or institutions. culture is one way of thinking about the development of an individual or group; and is thus also one way of thinking about the development of an increasing number of individuals.

<|endoftext|>

The notion of culture is without a master, either.  Therefore, a culture is a system ororganised culture that is held up as an ideal, but in fact is a dialectic between different levels of culture.  The concept of culture can be used broadly, to designate specific forms of culture, and even to discuss individual peoples or sub-groups. Culture includes everything from mundane practices (e.g. diet, daily routines), through institutions (church, military, education) up to ‘high’ culture (literature and art).

<|endoftext|>

The concept of culture can be tested by chance. In nature, cheerfulness is found either in the absence of a master or in the striving for greatness through cunning. In a culture of culture, this is not the ‘actor is the subject of this culture’, but the ‘actor is the fans. This idea of the isolated and unmastered, the violin player is certainly not the type of person who either becomes ‘mad’ or ‘loves’ music. The existence of such a culture is felt as the pathos of distance.

 pairs but a continuous narrative of struggle, of victorious alternations of breeding and reproduction. The tiger is a reminder to Asian peoples ‘the backward way’ that bravery is a virtue associated with strength, and which is also a symbol of those characteristics that come with nobility. The figure of a tiger is an echo of Plato’s analogy, where the tiger is a masculine and feminine, but also feminine and masculine orientations. Also, the tiger is a representative of the broader ‘aristocratic’ continent, where creativity and progress are rapid and unbroken.

The tiger is one of the animals associated in mythology with Dionysus, which explicitly refers to fat. The tiger’s wildness is not tamed by, but directly not opposed to Dionysus’ needs or purposes. As one lush growth of the tropical south, the tiger is a symbol of wanton and sudden destructiveness (always about to leap) and over-abundance (‘Homer’s Contest’). Thus, also the tiger is the figure of that sudden urge to traitorous injustice among the Greeks, which requires the state to keep it in check. This tension can be seen negatively as unresolved, lacking perfection or direction. The ‘higher men’ are compared to a tiger that has failed in its leap – that is, ashamed of their action, and not accepting the role of chance in the growth of the human.

In general, the cat is an incompletely domesticated animal that it appears peaceful, loves comfort, but has a residual wildness, remains akin to a beast of prey and is mischievous or wilful. Also, the clouds are implied to cats, incapable of decision; and, cats are also compared with the figure of a woman. However, the cat is incapable of giving, reciprocity or love. In this, it is the opposite of the dog—moreover, the images of granite statues of cats, standing for old-fashioned values, heavy and unmovable.

<|endoftext|>

The notion of ‘category’ has a long history of philosophy, beginning with Aristotle. In Kant, the categories form a set of 12 essential and a priori concepts under which all experience falls. They thus describe the structure of experience and its limits but also supply a transcendental account of how knowledge is possible in the first place.

Causality is one of the critical physical and metaphysical lines of thought. There are several aspects. Although using some of the same concepts as ‘On Truth and Lies’useful as a kind of shorthand for describing and predicting, the concepts of cause and effect require us to posit the cause and the effect as separable and identifiable; that is, each must be a stable entity. In truth, a continuum faces us, and every causal event is an infinite number of processes. Cause and effect thus offer no real understanding or explanation. This simplifying treatment of cause and effect is founded upon a natural, but mistaken, analysis of will – our clear willing and effecting becomes a model for natural processes. Cause and effect do not follow ‘laws. This notion of natural law as something that ‘governs’ also is an illegitimate application of our (mistaken) notion of willing according to a maxim. The critique of causality also amounts to an evaluation of mechanical thought (all nature consists of pushing and pulling entities). Natural causality is replaced by the concept of a network of forces – that is with the will to power. Among other things, this new concept demands (as against mechanism) ‘action at a distance’. Importantly,  this concept of cause and effect includes a diagnosis of the psychological needs that might explain its adoption.

<|endoftext|>

Second, there are some natural processes at work that are gestured towards by the concept of cause and effect. This whole natural realm contrasts with an unnatural or anti-natural sense of cause and effect: the idea of a sin against God, ‘spiritual causality’, or the cause of itself that is both an account of God but also a model of free will. In all these cases, a cause is posited that lies outside the natural order.

<|endoftext|>

The third strand of thought concerning causality is the notion of sublimation, in which a force or desire has its ‘direction’ changed – that is, its mode of discharge – by a second force or passion. There, the distinction between a vast quantum of power, and a smaller trigger, serves to give the former direction. The latter would be the ends we set ourselves for tasks or our lives. But these are often ‘beautifying pretexts’ – the real function of the discharge is hidden from us.

 pairs into two; the first rooted in Greek mythology (The Birth of Tragedy), the Second in Plato's Republic and the third in Aristotle. The historical Jesus gives us a comprehensive account of the nature of the philosopher, its value, and the dangers that confront it must hew to it. Kantian and Platonic in spirit are closely related, but they both decline to play bridge after the manner of Wagner. Key to the two-tiered philosophical approach is the recognition that nothing is trivial or incidental, and indeed always offers a way forward, spoiler alert.

The two elements of which modernity is most proud are incompatible. Science and culture require a ‘scholarly’ or ‘aristocratic’ class which has leisure. This leisure can only arise at the expense of a ‘slave’ class, and this is in direct contradiction of the dominant modern belief in liberal values of equality and democracy. Thus, the function of a class is not ossified, and the working classes also offer the greatest hope for the formation of a genuine people. 

<|endoftext|>

Both biological types and historical circumstances are temporary instruments available to a people – and behind any people, life itself – to further those ends necessary to the people or life. These ends include survival, no doubt, but more importantly, the enhancement and expression of power. A class system is, then, for as long as it serves these ends – regardless of whether its origin happens to be intrinsic or extrinsic. Historically, from out of these hierarchies, moral values and religious ideals were developed, either as images of the distinctive virtues of the various classes, especially the highest – or in reaction against them (the slave revolt in morality). Thus, any deliberate attempt at the creation of new morals must involve a change of class structure. Often, a system of values will outlive the class structure from which it arose. A future in which the necessity of class differences will be appreciated and welcomed, and a new ‘caste’ of cultural leaders will appear. The existence of such healthy differences among individuals or groups is felt as the pathos of distance.

Any number of other symbols may be reference to this concept of cleanliness, such as fresh air, clarity, brightness, health, nakedness. Cleanliness is opposed to filth, dirt, murky waters. It should also be noted that Leiblichkeit has the same root as rein or Reinet (pure, purity) and these concepts have something of a moral and religious connotation.

<|endoftext|>

Cleanly, to be sure. – One who dresses in clean- washed rags covers cleanly, to be sure, but still raggedly. Its point is to distinguish between a literal and figurative meaning of cleanliness – the latter corresponds to something like nobility. In other words, a condition of the possibility of nobility is not wealth, but freedom from abject poverty. Analogously, the cleanliness of a child ‘transforms’ itself into something more spiritual later, including ‘purity’.

<|endoftext|>

Another aspect of the symbolic meaning of cleanliness is honesty. That is, purity now refers to a set of intellectual practices that refuse unclear thought practices, particularly those that defer to a metaphysical beyond (e.g. religious institutions and the beliefs they embody).  The notion that religion (Christianity in particular) is not clean enough for the spirit is made again. This functions as a kind of summary of the critical reflection of Christianity. Particularly pertinent to this image is the crucial thought of Christianity in terms of its darkness or murkiness, that is its willingness to be dishonest. Also bound up in the perception of uncleanliness is Christianity’s association with the herd or slaves; its attempt to crush nobility; its moral attitudes are often masking lecherous desires; its contempt for the body creates filth (e.g. in sexuality) – indeed, even cleanliness is seen as sensuousness, that is as filth.  Only under strict rules is Christianity willing or able to challenge itself; likewise, the cleanliness of a people is both a condition of the self-overcoming of Dionysus and the saint reconciled to the human (as opposed to those who are old and sinned). This notion of questioning is in contradiction to the Socratic maxim. Thus, what is unclean is ‘common’. Once a work has been produced (e.g. an act done, a book published) then it is in the collective sphere; if saw at all, it becomes universal. Nobility cannot be judged, then, by acts or works. Only a noble reserve, solitude and self-respect could keep its spiritual cleanliness.
