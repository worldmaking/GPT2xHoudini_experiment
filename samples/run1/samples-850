 the words "spiritual substance" with the meaning of spiritual growth or downfall – and this is in addition to the 32 millionsth constituent parts of the total. It is repeated that all creation is a wonderful allegory of the great human who can illuse the world, and yet cannot generate greatness.

In the second phase, all creation is beautiful, except for the very first: creation of heaven and earth as allegories, a stage in the evolution of the human. Thus, the primary purpose of the Metaphysical Treatise is not to create idealised or falsifiable worlds, but to reveal and justify those very different from the ordinary. 

<</if>

In the third phase, we find a sceptical or even damning view taken. The earth is given a chance to develop after the death of tragedy, but this is repeatedly not mentioned. The emphasis now is on the relationship between height and brightness, and especially on the lowly.  The emphasis now is on the strong and beautiful, as well as the weak and lame, and even camelback. This is a profoundly mistaken conception of human life and its opportunities.

In the evolution of the self and of the human, and especially of the human body, the need to look after itself is an essential, but not entirely excusable, nature. This necessity is sometimes called the ‘transforming’ of the self. This transformation must be first soul, foremost, to make way for a ‘great Self’. Here, the transformation is not in the domain of values, but in the sphere of life and death.

<</if>

The idea of the self is subjectively false, and therefore, must be abandoned as a possibility after the blink of an irrelevant technological light. The self, in a sense, is the fullness of the human, and not just the fuzzy idea of an identity or an identity per se. The self is, in a way, an overdramatic collection of 32. The self becomes, in a way, a great many millions of times more manageable. The self becomes an essential uncleanliness to be sure, but not for long periods. The accumulated self-contraband becomes the essence of the human. It is, then, a single, continuous and permanent thing. The human is a chaos of self and degeneration.

The notion of becoming is suspect in several important ways. First, becoming difficult or impossible. This is often implicitly acknowledged as a noble trait: those who are able are admired. Second, becoming spiritually active is blissful ignorance; those who are spiritually degraded are called to account. Third, the highest human beings of the last several billion years are those who were transformed by means of Christianity under the care of priests. Such transformation is called ecstatic reintegration. Not all experience is blissful ignorance, and the re-analysing of one’s instincts after separation from God; in general, the experience of being is a disputing about having to accept new forms of life. reintegration is thus a turning away from the genuinely human (and towards the metaphysical Kantian view that all experience is blissful ignorance), and from the genuinely human (the deification of the body) to the Wagnerian thought that every aspect of being is a disfigured mirror to be refitted from. The realisation that there are two fundamentally incompatible claims – that the two are the real (and only way of living, breathing, and evaluating) and that the difference is vast and pervasive.

The metaphysical level is that of truth expressed in terms of values, rather than in terms of facts, and this has practical consequences. For example, values change points of view and people develop different means of communication. Moral systems are those based on the negation of value (e.g. the feeling of guilt) and guilt is no longer felt as a mind-numbing experience but as a fundamental necessity. The concept of value becomes a comprehensive description of human behaviour and involves consideration of all the ways in which the modern state affects daily life.

The concept of becoming broadens further, to consider all the various ways in which the function of the degeneration of the human is manifested in the context of the emergence of a higher ideal: the recognition of one’s place as fully human and able to carry out the human race as itself. That is to say, values are tools for achieving heights that one can only dream of – and that is for a variety of different purposes, from academic discipline to the observation of the great people.

<|endoftext|>

The notion of becoming broadly old-fashioned, as if by magic, since it has to be understood differently from life to life. In modernity, this is seen as a primary purpose – to justify the maintenance of rigidly

======== SAMPLE 2 ========
 the idea that there is something fundamentally different about human beings and even some other kind of life. Such a life is beautiful, and indeed committed to, but beneath it all the nobility of the noble. Therefore, the most noble of us is the one who can genuinely delight those who are struggling, and not suffer to one side and one’s world weary underfoot.

The highest form of life involves the most external experiences, motivating both the writer and the philosopher. The writer, in this sense, is meant to be unique – and therefore, the best kind of human. The philosopher, on the other hand, is a disfigured people with a long history and a murky future. There, the problem is defined and moderated, and the concerns expressed in the summary of the progress of science and philosophy. The problem of the relationship between science and the relationship to the higher human is expressed in how the concern with the 'too-serious' philosopher might conflict with the concern with the 'good' philosopher.

The expression ‘ to speak of a thing, esp. food, or any other aspect of the body’ got repeated many times that talking about things is ‘overlooked’ – that is, the thing is understood as a whole being represented, and appreciated, in all its various, exotic, and often disturbing forms. In other words, the ugly side of things is found in everything that is or is not represented, even to the things that aren’sselves noble.

The metaphysics of soul says it all: the rigorous investigation of the separability and separate identifiability of soul and body, and the metaphysics of substance itself, amounts to an attack on the notion of soul in favour of the claim that soul is a small part of the whole of ourselves that are separate and distinct. This is a bad idea, however, because insofar as the separability of soul and body is an essential condition of the natural world, and insofar as these separability concerns at best a negative aspect of the whole, then theism will be right around the corner. In other words, the discussion of soul is overblown and irrelevant. Nevertheless, the claim that atoms are the only suitable element between matter and metaphysics is a bad analogy for the purposes of discussion. The atom is a system – a conventional solid-state drive – and it has lost its strength and capacity for sustained being. That is, the atom is a system without universalizers or drives, or with stable and indivisible amounts of data. There is also no systematic analysis of the nature of matter or its constituent parts, and no easy conversion from lump to substance. The focus now turns to the question of what kinds of things are genuinely useful – and what is value’.

The word 'society' gets repeated many times that it refers to a social group or type of human: the individual is a social unit. However, the broadly held notion that group is synonymous with class, or with having a specific democratic socialist form of life (i.e. an ideal where all groups are represented). also means to reproduce, share, and reciprocate the instincts of the individual. Likewise, it is also responsible for the preservation of group health and for the rapid emergence of a modern form of life. 

<|endoftext|>

The concept of the individual has its roots in Kant’s account of freedom of association. In Kant, parties act as individuals, and the primary state is ‘sessionman’. The self is an ensemble of drives, drives that is, at the same time, drives together. The self also is responsible for the externalization of self-contradiction, the need to avoid becoming associated with the outside world, and the need to work with and respond to these externalizations.  Self-contradiction is thus an essential condition of life.

The concept of the state has its origin in Carlyle’s notion of the executive power of the people. The executive power of the people is the sovereign individual and is exercised with great pleasure. This is entitled ‘respect’ for the feelings and character of the state and its institutions, but extravagance and pride not so much. Besides, the people are people with power, and not individual individuals. Compulsory servitude is thus a sublimation of the ability to function as an individual. However, if excess and corruption are to occur amongst individuals, the system will have to crack down harder on the decadent, freeing the soul to pursue a otherworldly future.

The notion of democracy has a similar framework. Following from the Leucippus concept of democracy, which is defined as the holding of political power

======== SAMPLE 3 ========
 the form of the human in the distant future. At present, the ‘human’ state comprises only abstraction, masking the reality of physical and spiritual exhaustion, followed by severe intellectual labour and finally a collapse in value. Human beings will soon have to pay for their behaviour through the accumulation of power and wealth. It will be a turning away from the real and the excellent for evermore intelligent races. At least, it will be a turning back from the instincts of long, drawn-out drives that made up the great human.

<|endoftext|>

The instincts are, therefore, always going to be developing a kind of defensive mechanism in response to stimuli, and this is destructive even to internal organs. This destructive aspect is the basis of many psychological theories of the nature of morality. The notion of the agon is based upon a synthetic conception of the body that does not involve the notion of the developing of new healthy forms of the human. Instead, the gap may be bridged by a creative activity away from the pursuit of things – this is the realm of the rational. This activity will be guided by a pragmatic view of the value of human beings, particularly the self, as fundamentally different from and resistant to change. The relevant psychological theories of the nature of love, marriage or fatherhood will involve a dialogue with this notion of the necessary "break". The ability for significant others will be transformed into the capacity for passionate commitment to the highest degree.

The use of the word 'improve' in a vocation is 'transform'. That is, new and enhanced meanings and purposes may not be available to the old. This is known as the 'transformational' meaning of the Renaissance. Transformative effects are the processes by which new and enhanced forms of the human might become available to a necessary new order.

<|endoftext|>

Another aspect of the metaphor of power is the operation of power. The identical power is ‘power for eternity’. Thus, by the same token, all conflict is destruction. This is not the case in contemporary politics, where a certain ressentiment is needed to bring about a change in the shape of the electorate. Also, the same ressentiment is responsible for the creation of the modern form of the democratic politician.

Similarly, what is written is written: the ‘literature of science is a record of beings writing', and it is this writing that is translated as knowledge. The goal here is to explore the important aspects of theoftext – and the ways that the  translation of  Greek  did not allow for the natural flow of thought. 

<|endoftext|>

The literal meaning of the ‘word of creation’ in Greek is ‘Word is the beginning of everything’. The problematic implication here is that creating out of nothingness is one thing, and entirely assuming the form of an entity – and thereby displaying the greatest ignorance – of the foundation of all things creation. Thus, the creation of words is an act of creation against all that is in common: the ability for an orgasm to open. The creation of words, however, is not an ordinary activity and is often a sign of the degeneration of the human. Thus, creating a new word is a ‘great creation’, although on its own, this is a great deal more work.

The distinction between creating and rejecting God is important. While creating one has Domain (what is created) within which one will will to be judged by the endOGR (greater realizations and human values); and similarly, the domain of words has aegis (one who does not yet have a genuine God), adequacy impels one to adopt a false (or at least unfulfillable) faith in the future. In truth, creating means rejecting the gods and their expressions of wishes, and much more generally, the positive contribution that this positive contribution can give. For example, most people in the neighbourhood I know are very much into the philosophy of music that I teach. Not all creation is positive, of course, but those who do tend to have a responsibility to them.

'Culture' stands for the variety of ways the human is raised and communicates to society: 'Ecce Homo' is a people, whose people were systematically cut up and passed on, and whose image is appropriated for posterity. It is for this reason that the Culture Room of theAdelaide Cultural Centre is so vital. The building is home to a generation of leaders who have sought to reintegrate the human into the broader cultural and economic world. However, the age of cultural ignorance is coming to an end, and the necessary reforms that have been institutionalized in modernity are only visible. This ends with the evolution of the
