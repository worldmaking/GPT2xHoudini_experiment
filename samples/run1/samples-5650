 for the formation of a people. The sovereign will to power is not merely the dissolute, nihilistic form of the individual; it is properly sublimated by a desire for power. The sovereign does not merely dissolve the self, for whom the self is merely an illusion; it becomes sovereign also. The sovereign also becomes the 'slanderer' – that is, does not pursue happiness even within his or her limits. Instead, the sovereign can and must pursue happiness, and this is in opposition to the dominant culture's dominant values. Thus, the ideal of a new form of life that can experience freedom is the most critical of these values. The sovereign can pursue happiness, both as the ‘slanderer’ and also as a ‘slanderer’ of the higher culture’. The film ‘A Question of Beauty’, directed primarily towards the Henry VIII period, is notable for the beautiful lightness of an individual and a ‘luminous self’, and is thus in opposition to the dominant modern faith in terms of religious faith, moral faith, or legal faith.

The love of one’s fate, specifically, a gratitude towards all that makes up the situation that I inhabit, and which has produced me in the way that I am. The root of the idea is found in the notion of ‘antiquarian history’. The interconnectedness of all things and events, this ‘all’ is effectively the whole course of history as far as that history ‘passes’, in part, through an individual. Amor fati is a ‘formula for greatness’. My love or gratitude comes from the fact that this fate produces me and does so as being capable of affirming myself and capable of having a creative role in the future.

The idea is closely allied to that of affirmation more generally:  to say yes to this situation is the only way of saying yes to oneself, and vice versa. It is related to the affirmation of eternal recurrence. Only an individual who embodied a healthy and ascending life; was spiritually attuned to such life (e.g. not deceived about themselves); also, could ‘redeem’ the past and present as if it were a product of their will, could genuinely love one’s fate. As such, accident, or chance (in any ordinary sense) is not relevant. Likewise, necessity is no cause for distress, for nothing can befall the lover of fate that is not also a product of the creative will.

Several thinkers argued that the real is the whole of it, and not just the part that is merely incidental or superficial. The real is the whole of it, and not just the part that is merely superficial or incidental. The real is the whole of it, and not just the part that is merely superficial or involves actual feeling. The real is the whole of it, and not just the part that is merely superficial or is somehow not real.

On the aspect of religious and theological meaning in ‘faith', here ‘faithment’ means to believe the faith of another world country, or of a people, but not both. In general, faith is defined against what is written down in the Bible, especially the kind that is written as historical, philosophical, or moral. But some people are more than just scribes, and thus also some who are merely scribes. Still, some people are just as sinful as others, and, in a few cases, even more so. There is a distinguish between these two ends and a Sassoon. Both are symptoms of a specific decadence, but the ugly truth is that this decadence is a part of a broader culture struggle against it.

<|endoftext|>

However, decadence not as a principle but as a needing to be well off, there is a distinction between the lower and higher and vice versa. The soul is aware of this decadence and seeks its redemption in the form of acreating beyond oneself; likewise, the rumination on past and future is in the contentment of one’s passions and self-respect. A few sections later, decadence becomes a relevant concept to the account of creativity considered as the turning of the individual against oneself.

Several thinkers argued that the most necessary characteristic of a people is its ability to form a class. The individual can become anything ‘exceptional’ because of their talent for creating’. Second, though, this talent for creating is notin itself exceptional, for it is a characteristic of a class. Such exceptionalism is a means of diverting the task of creating from out of the role of human, or of the degeneration of

An ageing and over-comfortable society produce either ‘mad or lame’, or occasionally both. Both types are forms of distressful lyric poetry. The latter expresses a desire for the individual to have overall health and survival, and to have the strength to will into the future. The sickly or discontented must be excised from their current task of growth and existence, and replaced by healthy individuals. The prophetic dreams are thus in a contrast to the seductress or perfectionist.

Apollonian is named after the Greek God Apollo; this is one of three drives that it is a key to understanding cultural production and cultural change, from the ancient  Greek world on. The other two are Dionysian and Socratic. A  brief period in which the Apollonian and Dionysian work together produces ancient tragedy. The Apollonian is the origin of those cultural forms where beauty and clarity of form are emphasised (examples would be epic poetry, architecture, and sculpture), and the effects of calm or cheerfulness. Apollonian implicitly carries with it a metaphysical view concerning reality, that is, the belief that individual entities are ontologically original. Importantly, though, the Apollonian is also characterised by an awareness that these valued forms are an illusion to a Dionysian view of existence (a dream in which we are aware we are dreaming). Thus, the Apollonian should not be understood as a kind of self-deception or turning away from the real (that would be more akin to the Socratic). In his later work, the Apollonian is no longer thought of as a competing, brother drive to the Dionysian, but as a moment (of calm, stillness, beauty, image, etc.) within the latter. This is implicitly acknowledged that the ‘complete and authentic antagonism’ is between Homer and Plato: the former the deifier of life, the latter its ‘slanderer’.

The fundamental characteristic of things as they appear to us, including ourselves and bodies, is their givenness as individual form. This is Schopenhauer’s principium individuationis and the veil of Maya. Schopenhauer, in turn, was trying to interpret Kant’s distinction between appearances and things-in-themselves and incorporate ideas from Eastern thought. ‘Behind’ appearances are the will, continually striving and becoming, without form. Here, an important distinction arises between two senses of appearance: appearance as a symbolic image in genuine art, versus appearance as mere copy, and thus as possibly deceptive. Socratic thought is the forgetting of the first possibility of occurrence,  and therefore also as the advent of a modern faith in science. This theme continues throughout his career and involves analyses of how that which merely appears is denigrated for some ‘beyond’ or ‘behind’.

Human feeling is from the ground up, a simplification of the world so that it appears as intelligible, predictable, available for human beings to use. The ultimate motive behind this is utility: without such interpretations, human beings could not survive. Moreover, different peoples interpret things according to their specific situation (e.g. climate, resources, their enemies). Thus, differences in understanding the world arise, in terms of what is valued (and what is approved or disapproved of morally).

<|endoftext|>

Later, the notion of value becomes fundamental. If one rigorously rejects the hypothesis of a world, God or life that is somehow not here but ‘beyond’, then ultimately one also must rigorously refuse the notion of appearance itself. Appearance only makes sense in a way that is anthropomorphic. The idea of appearance becomes transformed into the notion of perspective or interpretation. A world understood as will to power is neither something in-itself nor is its appearance but is perspectival and evaluating. The building blocks of nature and very much, including the human, are perspectives or values – in other words, relations of will to power.

In Greek mythology, Ariadne was the Cretan princess who aids the Athenian Theseus in defeating the Minotaur in the labyrinth. Ariadne was the subtlety to Theseus’ destructive power. According to some versions of the story, Theseus promises to marry her but then abandons her on Naxos. There, the

Instrumentality is defined as the taking of active parts of the means of life (moral values, but by no means exclusively) from the task at hand, and the affirmation of a ‘future task’. The dog’s famous loyalty is shown in the form of a bear, and this bears a little more than a passing resemblance to the moderns; it stills those values that enabled modernity to overcome its stumbling-blocks. The dog is’s famous image means that part of him or herself that loves and respects him or herself; this is courage, the ability to stick firmly to life and the teachings of Jesus; it is akin to the spirit of gravity – keeping a close watch on everything, especially your actions and calculations.

‘The Birth of Tragedy’, with its lack of scholarly apparatus, energetic and figure-laden prose, philosophical and psychological speculation, and a mixture of ancient and modern contexts, was not what the philological community expected. It has three primary purposes and correspondingly divides into three sections. First, to elaborate a theory of ancient Greek tragedy as a synthesis of two metaphysically understood cultural drives (Apollonian and Dionysian). In this way, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ solves the relationship between cheerfulness and pessimism ingeniously - how could the Greeks, with their in-depth knowledge of suffering and futility, have remained cheerful? Second, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ traces the reasons for the decline of tragedy to a third drive, the Socratic, which is also the advent of science and modernity. Third, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ seeks to understand what it would mean, and what it would take, for tragedy to be reborn in the present. The account of culture is thus revealed to be a general one, and not specific to Greece. The book is heavily influenced (although not entirely uncritically) by Schopenhauer, and especially in its third part plays homage to Wagner.

Otto von Bismarck was the leading political figure in Germany from the 1860s to 1890. Bismarck provoked wars that in turn led to the unification of Germany around Prussian leadership. His brand of pragmatic and power politics, and his nationalism, made him as a symbol of all that was wrong with modern Germany.

Blood is a metaphor of life and a key symbol in Christianity for a life made eternal by being cleansed of sin. Notably, blood stands for the specific mode of life of an individual or group; thus, history transformed into blood: morals part of our ‘flesh and blood’. Blood is accumulated and passed down, forming peoples, types, or families (Geblüt means belonging to an aristocratic family line). Blood is that which makes one strong and capable of creating so that we have the vampire or leech images; also, the life-draining of specific ideas or practices, revenge, or asceticism or nihilism. Blood is precious; therefore, the mention thereof aphorisms and of things written in blood being an effort to read. Blood is also courage and the love of danger so that which is written in blood will take risks and those who read it to take risks with themselves.  Blood means sacrifice or martyrdom, which the idea is related to Christian symbolism, but also to Bismarck’s famous speech in 1862, where he uses the phrase ‘iron and blood’ to describe a nationalistic foreign policy not afraid to risk warfare.

Body means the human body as opposed to just any material object. If one rejects dualism – an account of the mind or soul as fundamentally different from, even separable from, the body – then bodily states are sensations, appetites, passions and so on, and thought and reason. In turn, this means that the one set of processes (those traditionally associated with a body) and the other (those usually associated with a mind) will require a similar set of explanatory accounts—this joint descriptive account in a materialistic account of physiology. The will to power seems to provide such an account that does not involve the metaphysical commitments of materialism. Moreover, these two sets must also influence each other (indeed overlap or coincide) much more than is thought. Importantly, the individual body is not necessarily the primary object of enquiry – groups based on gender, class, or race are treated as effectively one body. That is, certain groups are effectively a single organism. For example, the mobility and intermarriage of various human types vertically across classes, and geographically across
