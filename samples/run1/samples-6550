 romantic or sublime, and indeed already with some trace of nobility or virtue. If knowledge removes its ‘madhouses’ then, say, the thought of ‘housekeeping’ to describe conditions in an ordinary sense of occupation.

Considering Dionysian and Apollonian as primary drives are both either primary (e.g. nature or life) or only fragmentary (relationships, values, or modes of life). A relevant contrast is the one between these drives and Dionysian or Apollonian drives, as contrasted to more focused later concerns.

<|endoftext|>

The notion of ‘Dionysian’ or ‘Apollonian’ is not theologically significant, nor is it likely to have any significant implications for metaphysics. On the other hand, some aspects are (for example, the feeling of a duty to others, or a passion for substance). Thus, features that have traditionally not been considered as particularly significant are no longer considered as significant but instead as an artifact of the last resort, an expression of the fact that ‘my actions are the will to power’. This kind of ‘action’ is distinct from the ‘individual’ in that the will to power is a fragment of the whole, and ‘I.e. long periods of weakness and weakness’. Regardless, though, today, of the formation of a ‘semi-barbarbarale’, or the ‘distant future’, the concept of action is no longer relevant and worthy of mention. Because of this fragmentation, the notion of Dionysian or Apollonian drives is no longer considered as a distinct possibility, but as a significant possibility. Because of this separation, the discussion of action is deferred to the future, and imagination to understand the hidden world.

The notions of overworking and overtraining make a return. The first is a setting of moral concepts that involve a questioning of those practices (e.g. fasting, abstinence, etc.). The second is a turning inwards, to the right of the Rousseauian notion of the uncleanliness of habit. The third concerns are either the concept of action in terms of itsilateral consequences or itsité, the state of an individual or group.

The term of decadence with similar meanings include 'degeneration' and 'corruption'. 'Decadent' was a term of abuse used by French neo-classical or conservative critics against the romanticism of painters like Delacroix or novelists such as Hugo. Later, writers like Baudelaire adopted the term as their own, using it to express scepticism towards many dominant moral or political values. The usage of the word 'decadence' late in the late nineteenth centuries has represented the concepts of corruption, decline or degeneration date. Baudelaire is termed 'a typical decadency', and all references to him associate him with Wagner (Baudelaire was one of Wagner's champions in France). So, the meaning of 'decadence' is any period of cultural history – or any state of the human organism – which has lost its good taste and value judgement  (thus it is associated with pity; with Kantian duty; with Schopenhauer's quieting of the will), health and sureness of instinct, discipline and sense of a future. It is to be associated either with the decline of old cultures or with moral revolutions.

The Kantian and Platonic-Christian metaphysical distinction between appearance and ‘true world’ is termed a ‘sign of decadence’. For all these reasons at Christianity is called a ‘monster of decadence’. Decadent cultures are exhausted cultures, and such cultures often exhibit a pathological over-sensitivity; indeed, often an inability not to respond, lacking the strength to inhibit one’s passions. Alternatively, the decadent culture can manifest itself as a craving for stimulation (for the voluptuous, the exotic, the dangerous). Importantly, this desire for stimulation is a symptom and not a cause – as those who react ascetically against such stimulation believe. Thus, decadence in the form of a culture of exhaustion that needs stimulation often precipitated by a desire to humiliate the pitied.

Most of the above could serve as an account of the notion of degeneration or corruption also. If there is a distinction to be drawn from decadence, degeneration tends to have a stronger physiological emphasis, and is used more often in specific cases (e.g. the instincts of the criminal,  or the degeneration of individual philosophers), and is sometimes associated particularly with an increasing homogeneity of society (thus ‘

 romantic culture, and the expression of one’s greatness, by ‘discharging’ faith in a god. This requires, though, that the affirmation of a god’s existence, and any positing of new metaphysical questions, must be based on a falsified view of the nature of the true. This new form of metaphysics, more akin to anthropology, than sociology, serves as a vehicle for the creation of new values. A class system is, then, for as long as it serves this end – regardless of whether its origin happens to be intrinsic or extrinsic. Historically, from out of these hierarchies, moral values and religious ideals were developed, either as images of the distinctive virtues of the various classes, especially the highest – or in reaction against them (the slave revolt in morality). Thus, any deliberate attempt at the creation of new morals must involve a change of class structure. Often, a system of values will outlive the class structure from which it arose. A future in which the necessity of class differences will be appreciated and welcomed, and a new ‘caste’ of cultural leaders will appear. The existence of such healthy differences among individuals or groups is felt as the pathos of distance.

Any number of other symbols may refer to this concept of cleanliness, such as fresh air, clarity, brightness, health, nakedness. Cleanliness is opposed to filth, dirt, murky waters. It should be noted that Leiblichkeit has the same root as rein or Reinet (pure, purity) and these ideas have something of a moral and religious connotation.

<|endoftext|>

Cleanly, to be sure. – One who dresses in clean- washed rags covers cleanly, to be sure, but still raggedly. Its point is to distinguish between a literal and figurative meaning of cleanliness – the latter corresponds to something like nobility. In other words, a condition of the possibility of nobility is not wealth, but freedom from abject poverty. Analogously, the cleanliness of a child ‘transforms’ itself into something more spiritual later, including ‘purity’.

<|endoftext|>

Another aspect of the symbolic meaning of cleanliness is honesty. That is, purity now refers to a set of intellectual practices that refuse unclear thought practices, particularly those that defer to a metaphysical beyond (e.g. religious institutions and the beliefs they embody).  The notion that religion (Christianity in particular) is not clean enough for the spirit is made again. This functions as a kind of summary of the critical reflection of Christianity. Particularly pertinent to this image is the crucial thought of Christianity in terms of its darkness or murkiness, that is its willingness to be dishonest. Also bound up in the perception of uncleanliness is Christianity’s association with the herd or slaves; its attempt to crush nobility; its moral attitudes are often masking lecherous desires; its contempt for the body creates filth (e.g. in sexuality) – indeed, even cleanliness is seen as sensuousness, that is as filth.  Cleanliness as innocence is, of course, also a reference to the blood of Christ as cleansing one of sin; the ironic point here is that the Christian idea of sin is what creates the ‘dirt’ in the first place.

<|endoftext|>

However, the type of uncleanliness is not the worst thing; the worst thing is shallowness. This is a typical characteristic of modernity, especially in Germany. It is the product of an democratic community. The point concerns distance; that is, a herd is defined not by numbers, or cleanliness in an ordinary sense, but by thinking, speaking, and acting as one, and by assuming equality (e.g. touching). This is unclean in a spiritual sense because it must involve falsifications or simplifications, passivity, and weakness, and because it leads to a stagnation of the human. Thus, what is unclean is ‘common’. Once a work has been produced (e.g. an act done, a book published) then it is in the collective sphere; if saw at all, it becomes universal. Nobility cannot be judged, then, by acts or works. Only a noble reserve, solitude and self-respect could keep its spiritual cleanliness.

The emphasis of cleverness is on both a patient caution and on a subtle, hidden, and often inventive calculation bent upon reaping the rewards. The concept contrasts both with the ‘human of intuition’ in his or her abundance and beauty (‘On Truth and Lies’), with wisdom and with great foolishness. This cleverness, seen as a characteristic of modernity (regarding education, business or industry

Second, the dog is a metaphorical device’ (i.e. an object), an allegory (the atom, the star, the universe) or an allegory (the divinity of creator and serve). Thus, for example, a ‘god of war’ would be the ‘god of childbirth’. Similarly, history would be a ‘full account of the origin of disasters’. Third, ‘the habit of the noble to hunt down and punish those who have committed a sin’, and to punish those who have renounced their God, is a model of manneredness. This is a metaphor for the lack of stable relationships, the lack of self-respect and direction, the lack of creativity or honesty.

The first two are accidents, an accident is impossible. There is nothing mysterious or momentous about being or surviving in the real, and tragedy is transformed into an exercise in revenge. The third is the recognition that the real is dreadful and therefore appropriate. Here, the Canary is having a bad conscience, because, again, it is a form of self-overcoming. The self-overcoming is Dionysus, the dog of modernity. Here, the Canary is often symbolised as the ‘hero’ of tragedy, because this is not the ‘hero’ of culture, but the ‘hero’ of modernity. The dog is something that is supposed to be wretched, to play with herself. The sheepdog is an obvious metaphor for those who devote themselves to the protection of the herd. The firedog is noisy, spectacular, but irrelevant – and thus like the socialist revolution and similar events. The critical moments are quiet, creative of values. Zarathustra tells the story of a traveller accidentally stepping on a sleeping dog, making enemies of those who could be friends.

The term dream is used to characterize the Apollonian. The critical distinction here is not between dreaming and being awake; the dream is employed to understand a certain domain of culture, and particularly of art. The dream is a self-created world, one that is created to be aligned with our instincts of preservation and our need to justify our existence and our values. The dream is not merely an illusion – we can be aware of ourselves dreaming – but the validity of the beautiful forms that we dream are derived from their role in our health and our preservation, and not in their truth-speaking. In a general psychological theory of the dream, dreams are the way to make sense of stimuli through a retrospective ascription of causation. But this precisely is how we live our waking lives also. The analysis changes focus, to dreams as the space in which our drives act or realize themselves; again, this is like waking life.

<|endoftext|>

Moreover, not only is waking life not a great deal different from dreams but that, to the extent that we insist on it being so, this is a sign of weakness or degeneracy. Waking life is the domain in which our instincts or drives are despised, but the values expressed, and developed, in my dreams will inevitably find their way into waking life. Likewise, the degeneration of the will means that we moderns do not understand the 'freedom of the will' even in our dreams. Also, 'ancient humanity' continues in oneself, in both waking lives and a dream. So, 'what is "appearance" to me now? Indeed, not the opposite of some essence' – that is, appearance, even dream appearance, is again not contrasted to some straight-forward relationship to that which is true. Instead, 'appearance is the acting and living itself' – adjectives without an 'x' that they are adjectives of. 'Dream' thus becomes an essential element within the analysis of the 'true world' (MicrobeWorld). Such the world offers a chance to Zarathustra to do the impossible standing 'beyond' the world and 'weigh' it. Zarathustra wants to learn from and imitate his dream in his waking life. The dream, that is, can teach waking life how to allow healthy, life-affirming values to develop new ways of life. Likewise, a dream is again the moment of perfection and stillness that Zarathustra experiences after his frantic search for the origin of the 'cry of distress'. Here, the dream serves as a first reminder to Zarathustra that his pity may be leading him astray, and thus that his waking life has lost something. Sometimes, 'dream' or 'wakefulness' are used to quip a conventional sense of that modern Europe has overcome the 'nightmare' of Platonic thought and it can now sleep easy.
