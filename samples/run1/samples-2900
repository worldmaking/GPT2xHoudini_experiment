 to create a 'god' is thus an example of the need to create beyond oneself; likewise, in modernity, necessity has become too great for the humble. As for the creation of a god, this action needs to be religious in nature – namely, a religious faith in which all beings are created equal before the Godhead.creation of a god’s creation is thus an example of the 'creation of a people' from the 'apostasy’s'. The opposite views about the 'Dühring too strong' should be understood as a kind of cultural adaptation: for example, a religious 'god' can give people a good conscience but not a bad conscience. The analogy of creating a god is not, as it should be, sophomoric or drawn-out; instead, the god is a god’s mirror-image, wherever he or she is placed. The creation of a god is a dialog line, and is thus an appearance – but is in fact an illusion – and is in fact an essential aspect of the god’s symbolic nature. The god as created is honest, pure, and without bethought. The magician, though, cannot be a genuine cultural figurehead or communicator. Therefore, there is always the danger of him who wants to interfere in the realm of ideas or instances of self-overcoming. Therefore, the creator of religion must be someone like Bachaut or Wagner.

However, there is a problem. The Bachaut ideal is a generalized notion of mechanical overstatement, that is, a set of simplifications or ‘basictons’ that work in tandem with one’s intellectual and moral beliefs.  There has also been a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept of genius, as the ability of one’s opponents to convince oneself of one’s inferiorityour. More generally, though, than that, it is the genius at hiding behind the mask, that is allows us to avoid the more difficult questions that involve logic and truth-telling. Thus, the concept of genius is also used to characterize other aspects of the Bachaut ideal.

Control and Self-control denote reperching, among others. The idea of having control, especially over the self, is an essential source of the feeling of power. This can be in an ascetic sense, involving subordination of the self to an impossible or metaphysical ideal. Or it can be in the spirit of a productive subtlety in the war against oneself (self-overcoming). Self-control can also be associated with courage or strength.

Convalescence refers to the contrast between this life and another life, that is, creates a new life in contradiction of his or her instincts of preservation. A Convalescence is Now Theologically Demystified. The life of convalescence is represented by ‘Alexandrian’ literature critic Hugo Chaldini’s aphoristic prose, and by Theodor W. Convalescu’s magnanimous moral attitude. Convalescence is Tragic in Its Own Ground, a.k.a. the modern understanding of convalescence. Convalescence is Tragic in Its Own Ground, but Ascetic in Its Tragic Moment. Both are expressions of the longing humanity should have for such healing, and the desperation of those things that only serve to make suffering impossible. Thus, convalescence is also a moment of beauty and genius, when the ‘cry of innocence’ is transformed into a ‘stunning contrast’ against the more conventional explanations of psychological and metaphysical phenomena, such as manic depression and bipolar disorder. Convalescence is Tragic because it represents a transforming of the future, a turning back. This contrast between present and past is profound.

A conviction is a belief, held stubbornly to be 'unqualified truth'. There is a notion developed by the dangers and origin of conviction that one must be a 'noble traitor' to one's convictions. Convictions are opposed by both the genius of science and justice. Therefore, those who embrace science and justice are considered as the wanderer,  a thinker who has no home or 'destination' (both understood as convictions).

Courage and bravery are an ancient virtue that we need to appreciate and revalue. Courage is the ability to stick firmly to life and the real, and not to borrow one’s beliefs and values from imaginary other worlds or modes of being. Likewise, it is courage not to manufacture one’s beliefs and values by a fearful negation of becoming, uncertainty and suffering, which are the conditions of life and the real. Such courage in the type is represented by Epictetus (the Stoic philosopher who had been a slave)

 to do and to live. Likewise, it is about the wisdom of the herd. The herd is the one percent'ing the resources of the human, and the mechanism by which that human is created or developed. The shrewd enemy of the noble, the self-overcoming of oneself and self-contempt. Both are symptoms of pessimism, an enemy of the ideal of a new form of life that has a recognisable condition, a kind of endpoint.

'Ant' defers to the symbol of work, especially industrial, as part of a homogeneous group. Also, the animal kingdom is associated with a constant flow of resources, and thus with productive differences.

Anthropomorphism means to impose the form or qualities of the human onto something. The innumerable ways in which the histories of science, philosophy or religion have involved anthropomorphism. A key example is the concept of cause and effect in nature that this separation of cause and effect is an anthropomorphism, founded upon what is already a false characterisation of human action in terms of will. The whole of our knowledge of the world (including human beings) is anthropomorphic.

<|endoftext|>

On the one hand, then, these anthropomorphisms are illegitimate (they are ‘lies’), despite their enormous utility for human beings. On the other hand, there stays a danger of the destruction of culture through the simplification of culture (self-culture), and this danger is disguised by large symbolic acts such as the creating of art. The production of art is a crucial aspect of the description of the cosmos, to the extent that creating a new medical responsibility is a distinct possibility.

Culture is thought of as the variety of ways that the underlying Will has of keeping a people or a people alive, and especially stimulating or tricking ‘nobler natures’ who feel the burden of being. There has a distinguish between an ‘influenced’ and a ‘without’ culture, as well as between ‘hatred’ and ‘hatred of culture’. Both can be thought of as instincts, drive, or delight at the fact that a people is growing or has power, but the latter is a symptom of a system – one that is being broadly human. The engeved that is culture is primarily internal, and is thus a mechanism by which the understander is challenged back. The internal devaluation of culture is the ‘gathering of the weak and the discontented’ in order to produce the culture that is supposed to be powerful; the immersion into the higher world by means of reading and observation; or the stimulation of an over-religious reverence for the lost and ill.

In its primary sense, atheism is the positive assertion of the non- existence of anything like a god. To be sure, nothing like a god exists as either an independent physical or a transcendent entity. If gods are symbolic expressions of human ideals, however, then atheism in this essential sense is changed by the commitment to the Dionysian model.

<|endoftext|>

Abandoning a belief in a transcendent God is a step forward culturally. However, in general, the issue of a god’s existence is far from the most critical aspect. More important are questions like the following: (i) what does the need to seriously consider and ‘discern’ a god’s existence say about the believer?  (ii) What does unbelief say about the believer? More importantly, what does unbelief say about the philosopher? So, for example, atheism ‘today’ stays in the tradition of the ascetic ideal. Likewise, the hidden implication of theism with science, language or morality means that unbelief is often blind to its causes and consequences. (iii) What ideals are posited in a belief, or despite a lack of faith, in a god? The arising of a Christian idea of God is discussed, as far as Christianity is not the function of the survival, much less the growth, of a people. Moreover, Christianity is not just atheism, nor just any theism, and therefore atheism is not necessarily anti-Christian. Nineteenth-century English moral philosophy, for example, stays Christian even if it rejects theism.

Atomism is a theory of nature that posits as the ultimate constituent parts of nature small, indivisible particles that move, collide, and combine in space. The argument begins with Democritus and becomes an integral part of Epicureanism.  It is revived in the early modern period as the basis of many philosophical materialisms and mechanistic accounts of physics. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, atom

 to the actual; therefore, to the metaphysical conception of the imaginary lines of consciousness as being', 'of objects', 'of states' or 'of things'. When we talk about ‘life’, it usually links to this third kind of field of study, the sphere of influence, the realm of ideas or opinions that people have and their values. That is, ideas or values cannot be isolated but must be incorporated into the overall system of life. That is, those values that have come to dominate culture must be understood as part of a system that serves one dominant culture (the ascetic ideal) well before it is able to function as a form of evaluation. An example of this kind of evaluation is the role that the free spirit plays in several interconnected ways. First, he or she undergoes agonizing agonizing agonizing, always discovering a way around an agonising resistance. Second, though, this ideal requires both the athlete and the poet to be able to read and interpret, as if by magic, as the real. Third, though, such reading and interpreting requires a genius for such things: the ability to read and understand. So, for example, the life of an athlete is, in part, an account of a state of mind that is awake-to-reality, and which is also aware of itself doing and taking itself. Such an awareness requires both the ability to speak the truths of the realm of ideas but also a will to power. In other words, the dream is the network of power and will in the waking life. Will to power is a network that includes the dream and waking life.

The concept of being in a way akin to Parmenides or Plato: true being is that which is, eternally, and does not become. Moreover, even concerning everyday entities, that things we know are not genuinely permanent or self- identical, we still employ the concepts of being, as if they were true being. Belief in the existence of nature is a crucial feature of metaphysics and carries a moral value.

Belief has two different meanings in both English and German. First, belief in the sense of opinion, the unjustified or careless views that someone or a group happens to have. Second, belief in the spirit of faith, often now in a religious sense. A religious sceptic would claim there is very little difference between them. Still, in many philosophical traditions, there is a significant difference: one can acquire evidence such that opinion becomes knowledge, but the object of faith could not in principle be an object of knowledge. The notions of a disciple, or the ‘love of man for the sake of God’ should be understood as ways of rethinking the notion of religious faith in the absence of a transcendent or impossible object.

<|endoftext|>

Belief often relates to metaphysical or religious concepts as being objects of ‘faith,’ that these individual items of belief are part of a system which serves one dominant faith, around which one builds a form of life. In this case, it is the faith of the weak that they someday will be the masters; because these concepts are abstract, not the concrete expression of the life of a people, this kind of faith is universalising and arises from ressentiment. It refuses on principle to tolerate any other faith (or form of life). 

<|endoftext|>

However, opinions and beliefs are legitimated by the kind of person who holds them. There has differentiation between the opinions of ‘most people’ and those of ‘exceptional men.’ Those who live in the land of culture have no beliefs, but this is because they are ‘unworthy of belief’. But a people capable of creating must have a prophetic belief in their future.

Benevolence is an essential virtue, although not one well understood previously. The small acts of benevolence that people show to each other every day and counts the sum of little pleasures they evoke as, collectively, enormous. This effect arises even though benevolence is not unegoistic, and indeed founded upon a feeling of superiority. Pity is considered as a form of malice. Likewise, benevolence is a virtue associated with clear thinking and restraint, with the ruthlessness often attached to unclear thinking and sentimentality. Also, benevolence must be founded on a benevolent inclination towards the self  – this anticipates several key later ideas, such as the notion of a reactive will to power that is based on ressentiment, or the idea that the noble has self-veneration. Specific moral affects in terms of will to power are well advanced. Benevolence is traced back to the enhancement of power. After this point, benevolence drops out of view, to be replaced by other notions of virtue, notably veneration
