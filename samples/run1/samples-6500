Shrewdness is honoured both by the noble and by those of ressentiment, but it is also acknowledged as a virtue. Only in the latter is the capacity for wickedness to take root. The idea of cause and effectuality becomes a relevant criterion of value. value cannot be determined through chance or chance-synthesizing, for example. The existence of nature is posited as the main characteristic of a way of life; the relationship to culture is thought of as one large-scale, chance encounter. Precisely because of this character, and the frequent appearance of surprises, the idea of a ‘governing idea’ is a necessity. The roof is characterised by cold and comely concepts, and not necessarily an absence of anything exceptional. The thinker also must be aware of the necessity of uniting (a notion previously thought peaceful with sports, for example). The philosopher must be aware of the necessity of war, especially battle, and of the continuous flow of ‘heroic’ events and events, which is surreptitiously interrupted or distorted. A good analogy of this kind of situation is the flow of thought, thought, or action, and it offers both a ‘solution’ and a ‘error’.

The cloud has no symbolic meaning. If the Dionysian has reappeared in modernity, then the Greek sense of the Apollonian must also have appeared. There the theatrical practice of disguising behind a ‘cloud’ the ropes and pulleys of stage apparatus alludes that things (real or imaginary) are made to appear. This is known as the due’s ex Machina. However, this cloud is also an allusion to the Apollonian ‘cocooned itself away’; similarly, the cloud is a cocoon, and the open pit is the abyss – this cloud is also a cocoon. In addition, the cloud is that which obscures, or which is neither one thing nor another. The cloud is also, of course, the source of lightning either because it is elevated or because it is interpreted as fearful.

To comfort is to ease suffering, whether physical or spiritual. Tragedy presents suffering in a way such that we are protected by the Apollonian image (what we might call artistic comfort), and also that we understand that beneath suffering is an unbreakable unity and continuity of life (‘metaphysical comfort’). It is romantic pessimism, or practical nihilism, and already half-way to religious faith. The desire to relieve suffering is also part of the notion of pity. Christianity is a great treasure of the most ingenious means for comforting. The Christian ascetic priest cannot attack the underlying sickness that causes suffering but can combat its symptoms.

The primary condition of communication is the sharing of a language – a system of signs and significations. But what is signified is by no means either ‘raw’ (i.e. uninterpreted) experiences or things in the world; somewhat, these significations are changed by values. Therefore, having a language in common is dependent upon also sharing a set of values. It follows that communication of thoughts that depend upon a new set of values, or those values themselves, is the most difficult. Moreover, one’s values are a product of one’s constitution – for example, various inheritances from the past, including both cultural and genetic, the habits that form a mode of life, etc. So, to communicate genuinely new thoughts or values would be to transform the listener. There is the same problem with interpreting or understanding ancient cultures. Particularly to the ancient Greeks,  there is an aloneness that is difficult and perhaps impossible to bridge (‘Homer’s Contest’); alternatively, if it can be bridged, would result in a transformation of the present – this, for example, is the reason which gets repeatedly emphasised the Greek sense of religion.

This ‘pessimistic’ view of language is not the final word, however. That which is noble will have both a need and even an ability to communicate singular values ‘to men and things. Notice in these passages that the idea is expressed in terms of an overflowing of fullness. There is an echo in that passage of Kant’s notion of genius as having (among other things) the ability to hit upon a communicative vehicle for an idea that, in different ways, is inexpressible. This idea in saying that the purpose of style is to communicate states –  ‘I was the first to discover the great rhythm, the great style of the period’.

Butterfly is a vital image with far-reaching but not always clear implications. Broadly, the image of butterfly is in a negative, though also in a positive way. The critical meaning of the former is thoughtless living in and for the present. Butterfly is thus modern humanity with its newspapers and petty politics. There are two aspects to the positive meaning. First, the butterfly is childlike, innocent, and therefore able to relate to its world without the heaviness of values. Second, the butterfly is a standard mode of existence, lightly and laughingly affirming of its conditions and its fate. The butterfly, in this sense, is also eager for growth. The butterfly is used in this sense, but now with an emphasis on the problematic sacrifices that are the precondition of such growth. The idea of cocoon is about the Apollonian cultural drive being forced to disguise itself as mania for persuasion, but re-emerging in modernity.

Caesar is a Roman general, politician and first or second, and is a product of the decay of the Roman nation. It is honoured both for his bravery and for his eagerness for the task. To the Caesar, the Caesar is a modern figure, who can lead a people to greatness but not distress; to the Caesar, the Caesar is a rare insight into a people, hidden from view. This insight may be valuable for purposes of analysis, but not always explicit. The former concerns the discovery of important and ancient practices and institutions that the public considers 'evil'. The latter would include the harmful effects of customs or practices common to modernity. The former would also include the features that made modernity difficult or impossible for ancient Rome – notably the widespread adoption of language and sculpting,  and the influence of the philosopher's ‘archeologist’.

The devil has no symbolic meaning, but it does represent an important concept about the limits of the human. The human is portrayed through a light-footed, boxy exterior, and thus through all appearances. Moreover, the devil may be able to change his or her alignment to these ideals through actions. Therefore, those who embrace the concept of the ‘ devil’ are the first to discover its dangers and its joys.

To the devil, there is one verse. "I would rather be free than enslaved; than, at least, my actions would not be taken for like purposes" – an idea relevant to Baudelaire. The devil has three essential counterparts. First, the devil in moral practices; second, the devil in the will to the truth. Third, the devil indicates the interconnection of the good and the bad, the positive and negative (i.e. the notion that opposites are not opposite). Thus, the devil is just Christ’s peace and tranquillity, and the devil is the tyrant of the good. Second, the devil may be the figure of Wagner, the energetic new musical form inspired by Wagner. 

<|endoftext|>

The devil stands for a variety of reasons: first, that there are devil horns, ‘although a subtle hint of the saintliness may be in the spirit of horns’; second, the devil may be the figure of Wagner, the energetic noblest action of the great German. Third, the devil may be the figure of Zarathustra, the vampire of the pure and innocent. Only in this way could God's creation of man be possible, since that creation would involve the euthanasia of human life on the one hand, and the destruction of the human type on the other. Thus, the devil may be the most conventional version of the ideal, and the symbolic meaning of the term austere. Second, the devil may be the figure of Zarathustra, the ancient Persian religious figure. Finally, the devil may be the figure of the aphoristic spirit of the Church, which usually delivers to the following ideas that the devil is not the worst thing that happens to human beings, but that we are indeed in a collective doldrums.

The devil stands for a set of anthropomorphic animals, usually chosen for their animal aspect, such as the anthropomorphic sheepdog, and the anthropomorphic dogitan. The anthropomorphic dog is also often given the honoured distinction of valuing courage even in its opposite, such as the ‘higher men’. The dog is a human who acts as a kind of ‘guarddog’ against the positive aspects of the ascetic ideal. This kind of ‘guarddog’ is particularly relevant to the following section where ‘the dog’s famous courage is the key to the ascetic

, the first has a metaphysical basis, the second holds concerning natural processes, and the third concerns the evolution of states and the working of the mind. Finally, philosophers have considered as the basic principle of all knowledge, even the unauthentic, existence of a philosopher. The categories form a system of describing things and include essential and exemplary qualities.

The concept of mythic symbols represents the mechanism by which culture might be unified, and thus share the basis for communication concerning that which is genuinely significant. Also, concepts of metaphor, symbol, and allegory as mechanisms by which communication might be able to surpass its built-in limits. So, for example, the ‘man of intuition’ discussed at the end of ‘Truth and Lies’ occupies a world where things are liberated from their bondage under functional needs and accompanying values. Furthermore, the concept of Dionysian can also be considered through this fashion. This ‘inspired’ state is thus key to the noble attempt to communicate to and transform others. However, the free spirit sometimes needs to avoid communication even to his or her closest friends, either to protect the self and its ideals or them.

"God is such a bad communicator" - the joke at the expense of religious controversy, which was often over points of interpretation, and the recently developed science of biblical hermeneutics, the purpose of which was to apply the rigorous methods of philology and history to sacred texts. Such lousy communication leads to scepticism and atheism; it, thus, drives to the death of God.

Comprehensiveness is a concept without a single term to name it. Comprehensiveness describes an individual who encompasses and can employ a variety of different states, drives or types of knowledge. Thus, comprehensiveness stands especially in contrast to the specialization typical of modern intellectual life. It is related to the idea of the multiple (the human soul is various), and to the wanderer who has no fixed cultural home and sees and takes part in much. Comprehensiveness also describes the various abilities, all separately developed in human prehistory, that needed to come together to make the thinker. Analogously, it either links to the emergence of the comprehensive ‘individual’ who can live ‘beyond’ the morality of some old, decaying culture. The philosopher must be able to see with many eyes, to view things from many perspectives; to develop this ability of  ‘brief habits’—similarly, the ability to function concerning both science and other aspects of culture.

<|endoftext|>

Comprehensiveness is thus a feature of a future philosophical nobility, to be distinguished from the nobility of a narrowly perfected culture, as well as from the anti-culture of the historical sense. This historical sense is a kind of comprehensiveness but without discrimination, without any setting of limits. Such an ideal requires dangerous experiences to enable judgements about the value of modes of life. Greatness is judged in fact by the ability for comprehensiveness. Comprehensiveness thus describes a height that is not that of abstraction and represents an overall responsibility for the development of the human, and which can use a wide variety of cultural forms and institutions as tools. Such responsibility will be able to take on all the hopes and disasters of the past and present, and still rise joyfully to greet the dawn. Thus, comprehensiveness is also related to the ideas of the gift and pregnancy.

When talking about concepts, philosophical concepts or the fundamental concepts of a religion or culture, it refers to, for example, substance, cause, virtue, sin. Any discussion of concepts, therefore, will also be a discussion of philosophy, metaphysics, religion etc. Concepts form a system – that is, individual concepts cannot be isolated but must be understood as a whole way of thinking (and living and evaluating), and likewise studied in their historically developing and repeating interconnection. Philosophical concepts are later and dependent upon the underlying values that produce language. Thus, for example, philosophical concepts are governed or generated by the grammar. Even the belief in the validity of concept-formation has philosophical implications. Concepts may also be able to influence those values. When, under the pressure of discoveries or critique, a concept gives way the result is memorably described as a ‘concept- quake’.

About the concept of conditions, it is a  broad contention that nothing is isolated, pure, or unconditional, that is everything is only properly understood in its concrete context and by following the various ‘conditions’ under which it developed and continues to evolve. By ‘conditions’ are meant historical period, culture, values, language or psychological forces, or education and other institutions. Pity – in the form of protective institutions like hospitals, or
