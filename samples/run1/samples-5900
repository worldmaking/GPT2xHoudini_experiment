 gods would struggle against being or degenerate.

The root of the idea is found in the notion of ‘antiquarian history’. The interconnectedness of all things and events, this ‘all’ is effectively the whole course of history as far as that history ‘passes’, in part, through an individual. Amor fati is a ‘formula for greatness’. Mylantoin is a ‘formula for submission’. The interesting part is that  these terms are sometimes associated with capacities for creativity (life, creativity, genius or ill).

The struggle is either among those of equal power, or unequal. The former may yield enhancement (for both parties). One reason struggle may not be productive is that it is not among them productive is (a) the knowledge that ‘I’ will suffer if this struggle is to be productive, and (b) the belief that this suffering will be appreciated. The idea of ‘fight or flight’ is a crucial aspect of such discussions.

The struggle is either among those of equal power, or unequal. The former may yield enhancement (for both parties). One reason struggle may not be productive is that it is not among them productive is that it is not among them productive. On the other hand, some aspects are quite noble, like the recognition that the course we adopt is hers; likewise, some of the ancient practices that organized the human into a ‘beast’, including the ‘ enslavement of the gods’. Some of the most beautiful of all types are  the ‘struggle’ with illness or stroke. Fighting is a way of discharging these strong drives in the belief that they can overcome others. Fighting also involves the waving off of moral values, values that have long since been superseded by values. Thus, the metaphor of everything being a fight, and thereby very differently organized, is an important one.

The struggle is either among those of equal power, or unequal. The former may yield enhancement (for both parties). ‘The struggle is between a fixed class and its Goddess’s creation in a random and senseless manner. This is akin to the tension of the real, or the unrealicity of the real-life. The struggle is either among humans or things in the realm of possibilities. The real-life, though, is a product of the inversion of human values into the impotent rage of the infinite. This is the ‘struggle’ between gods and men, between good and evil, between preservation and degeneration, between preservation and destruction.

The struggle is either among those of equal power, or unequal. The former may yield enhancement (for both parties). The real is a product of the inversion of human values into the greatness of the great. This is akin to the pride of the noble or the pride of the slaves. The great are both clouded in beauty and degeneration. The cloud is godlike in aspect, but also sublimely so. The ugly has its roots in the ‘suffering’, but the pure has its ‘slanderer’s malice. The point concerns the elevation of the austere ideal to the perspective of 'pure', pure affairs. This is the period of cultural history where ‘modern’ affairs are genuinely sovereign, and for which the will is the creator of life. The sovereign will is, therefore, the one who can create and rule without the aid of masters. The sovereign will is thus the creator of suffering and anarchy.

<|endoftext|>

The most sustained treatment of the theme of ‘the abyss’ is presented in the Treatise of GM - that the aim here is to explore the sovereign's role in the growth of the 'free world’. The Treatise then develops the notion of ‘the abyss’, specifically the sovereign becoming 'at the mouth of the abyss’. The sense of the abyss is employed to discuss the reality of things, their limits, and the possibilities of their development. The discussion of things then turns to the possibility of creating or surpassing these things. The concept of the abyssus also becomes a focus of attention. Thus, the thought of creating are later employed to discuss the possibility of genuine ascending.

Aesthetics is a theory of the aesthetic (visual oraudio

 gods of God is founded upon the belief that these various ways of affirming and reassuring the course of their growth coincide. That is, the philosopher must simultaneously reject the notion of permanence (a state of affairs dependent upon things like food, or oxygen in the air), and also take a wrong turn in his or her ascent to greatness. This means, though, that asceticism is a mode of living that seeks to cancel out experience – but that is a contradiction, and (at least at the physiological level) must be only an appearance. That is, the ascetic ideal must be somehow a way of a degenerated life-preserving itself at all costs. The priest is a kind of ‘doctor’ to the sick, serving to change the direction of their ressentiment to make it harmless. Instruments to this end are described from sections 17 to 20.  This institutionalisation of the sick and weak is also a valuable separation of them from the healthy. Both science and historiography (history understood as a scientific undertaking) are complicit in the ascetic ideal; likewise, atheism which stays ascetic in its will to the truth. In the end, the ideal ascetic means that the will to power can will anything (even nothingness), but cannot will  – that is to say, the ascetic ideal is the last recourse of a diseased form of life attempting to prevent itself falling into a ‘suicidal nihilism’. How the dangerous aspects of the ascetic ideal are to be overcome is not focused on here. There are two clues: first, through comedy, that is through a light-footed, mocking irreverence; second, through the will to the truth coming to consciousness not as a principle but as a problem. Asceticism can be naturalised, that is a return to the original Greek concept of askesis (training), a discipline of improving strength and health.

‘Asia’ or the ‘East’ usually delivers to the following ideas that Russia as a significant rival to European power, or as a critical origin for nihilism and anarchism;  culture, social systems or philosophical systems in India or China, founded on Hinduism or Buddhism; relatedly, China about its capacity for an industrious class without resentment; the area to the east of Greek civilisation, particularly as the ‘prehistory’ of the Dionysian.

Ass can be a general term of abuse, connoting above all stupidity and dullness or slowness. All humans, from a higher perspective, are idiotic. To the concept of ass, the distinctive braying is ‘i-a’, thus ‘jay’ or yes – the ass stands for indiscriminate affirmation, lack of taste. The ass sometimes replaces such meanings as stubborn, enduring, and even intelligent; as a weight-bearing creature, the figure of the ass sometimes overlaps with the more familiar image of the camel. The festival of the ass is akin to one aspect of the Greek ‘Dionysian’ festival – the suspension of cultural and social order; likewise, there are Medieval traditions with a similar theme. Also, the ass is made sacred in some myths of Dionysus. Moreover, worshipping the ass is akin to the final nihilistic stages of religion, but here in a joyous and festive spirit.

A modern conception of space means the vast, mostly empty and cold distances between stars or planets – an excellent symbolic vehicle for his notions of the pathos of distance (‘too distant star’), the infrequent appearance of greatness, nobility, friendship, solitude (the image of the star emitting light into the darkness, also notice the allusion to solar flares) or untimeliness (‘the light of the stars needs time’ ). Likewise, it serves to convey the cosmic insignificance of human beings and even the chaotic nature of reality overall. Similarly, also the methods of astronomy are employed: not seeing the stars as ‘above you’ – that is not transcendent in nature.

In its primary sense, atheism is the positive assertion of the non- existence of anything like a god. To be sure, nothing like a god exists as either an independent physical or a transcendent entity. If gods are symbolic expressions of human ideals, however, then atheism in this essential sense is changed by the commitment to the Dionysian model.

<|endoftext|>

Abandoning a belief in a transcendent God is a step forward culturally. However, in general, the issue of a god’s existence is far from the most critical aspect. More important are questions like the following: (i) what does the need to posit a god’s existence say about the believer?  (ii)

Beauty is both a narrower and a more comprehensive concept: more restricted, because not all art has been beautiful as its aim or effect; more extensive, because not all that is met as beautiful is art. Beauty plays a role as the healing quality of the Northern Limit, the over human. This is a symbolic image of the beauty and freedom of will of the noble, but also of the over human. The idea of feminine beauty is a crucial one, as the relationship between equality and tyranny. Beauty is also closely associated with the ‘good’’, and with the elevation of the human to the status of the godmimic. This duality may be useful in thinking about the Dionysian. We also get a portrait of soft power as something precious, something that little more than reiterates the over-abundance of beauty. 

<|endoftext|>

Beauty is a quality of the ideal (e.g. the gods) that a human value sets for itself; thus, beauty is a human measure, ‘given’ to the world, by means of which it affirms or even worships itself. Thus, the metaphor of everything being a mirror to one’s beauty. The spectacle of ascending life is beautiful; degeneration is ugliness. As again in Plato, an attraction in itself is not the goal or endpoint, but instead either a sign of health or that which ‘lures’ one towards further creation (the soft voice of beauty and wisdom and life personified). Thus, for example, experiences are the seductress, teasing with beauty; or beauty is a culture’s imagined happiness; likewise, the beauty of the over human. Such disinterest is both physiologically impossible (or at least unlikely), but more importantly also a perverse conception of what is beautiful (‘immaculate perception’). Instead, what is given up for the sake of beauty is only the ‘hero’s will’, and this leads not to disinterest, but ‘godlike’ (rather than heroic) ‘desires’. In other words, disinterest is at best a stage, an overcoming of what is merely a fragment of the whole will towards the over human.

The concept of "Becoming" falls under two main headings: historical analysis and metaphysics. By the first is meant an exploration of the origin and development of beliefs, values, institutions, or other forms of life. For example, a 'science of art' that investigates the becoming of miraculous works. The significance of this kind of investigation lies in the fact that many values (moral values, but by no means exclusively) receive part of their value from the assumption that they are eternal, God-given, or at least natural laws. Questioning this is part of questioning the value itself.

<|endoftext|>

Moreover, the historical investigation often shows that a given amount has its origin in its closest moments, and thus involves a kind of practical contradiction – so, for example, Christian morality arises from out of affects that it would consider 'evil': namely, envy and revenge. Finally, such historical analysis is valuable because it opens new possibilities for values. So, for example, the historical self-overcoming of religion then culminates in the discovery of an 'opposite ideal'. 

<|endoftext|>

The metaphysical sense of becoming involves an attempt to investigate the nature of the real. At the level of insight at least, there is only constant disordered change. Becoming can be understood in at least three fundamental ways: first, that what is real is chaos, without form or order. The problem with this first view is that it supplies no explanation of why the appearance of structure or order occurs. Moreover,  the dissolution of contemporary culture into its historical becoming produces a cultural paralysis, one that leads to pessimism or nihilism. Second, that what is real is something like a process, that creates and then changes various forms, with some overall sense of direction or an endpoint. Similarly, a traditional account of the freedom of the will robs becoming of its ‘innocence’.

<|endoftext|>

The third possibility is that what is real are, again, something like processes, but which interact and produce irregular forms only to dissolve them back. Here there is no overall coordination of these processes, no ‘purpose’ or ‘end’, except for what human beings posit for themselves as purposes. There is indeed constant change, without stable entities (i.e. without beings, such as atoms or substances), but through the process, forms are realised only to then be replaced by new types.
