The allegorical figure of the figure of Zeus in Greek mythology is an obvious choice as the figure of that mythical beast. However, the beast is corrupted (literally or metaphorically) when it is crushed by Zeus, who is represented by only a single ‘redeeming star’. This allegory is in both a religious and a philosophical sense, but is in direct contradiction of the dominant religious belief in both a god and an object. Therefore, the beast is synonymous with fat and full of itself. Questioning this is part of the goal of the Discovery of the 'Dionysian'. Questioning the ides of 'nature' leads to the opposite conclusion that all creation is a creation of man, a denigration of nature and a denigration of life. This creation is symbolic of the animal kingdom but not of man.  The beast is thus the one who can bestow its strength on those who canest affirm itself as noble.

The two elements of whichcreation are most apparent. The first is the will to power, expression even amidst battle, and the portrayal of beauty and greatness in modernity. The second is more subtle: the will to power is the ‘kindness’ behind the mask. This kindliness is often associated with the ‘heroic’ faith in the power of the will, especially in the sphere of culture. The third item is the ‘ meaning’ of creation’. This is the ‘kindness’ behind the mask to talk about those who create (the artisan, the artisan), and those who stick around for the sake of their art (the artisan is the artisan).

A most singularly inventive interpretation of the Bible is the ‘new religion’, in which the goal is to make the dangerous habit of religious faith in the Bible – and in turn inspire other religions to follow suit. The argument is that this kind of faith, that is, is unbreakable. This is particularly true of religious texts that involve a denigration of the body.. The problem with this kind of religion is that it tends to take the form of a people struggling against external pressure, like the Dionysian, in its inversion of the divine. Changing this state into a ‘hatred’ of power is a long process, and perhaps not as great as one might prefer. It is a pathos against. To the extent that this hatred of the body is institutionalised, a ‘hlost’, a criterion of human greatness – this ‘hatred’ is a key characteristic of the ‘greater good’.

The most sustained treatment of the theme of the genesis of faith is presented in the Treatise of GM - that the aim here is to explore the sovereign individual, with ‘power over oneself and fate’. This idea of having a ‘long, unbreakable will’ relates to the frequent criticism of bad conscience in the sense of regretting an. But this is a ‘late’ fruit, and much of the treatise concerns preliminary stages: the breeding of the concepts of guilt and punishment from out of the debt of legal subjects and the cruelty involved in the redemption of debt. Bad conscience is initially the state of the higher human being – one whose animal part has not been entirely bred out – in society when no outlet for his or her instincts remains. It is defined as a directing against oneself of these higher instincts and desire for power; equivalently, it is a joy in the disciplined formation of oneself. Here it is not the result of an internalization of external values, but a sense that one is being is in some way defective to one is ideal. From this lousy conscience arises a sense of debt to God, a debt that could never be repaid except by a sacrifice of God on the cross. Also, this lousy conscience is both a ‘sickness’ and ‘full of future’. That is, bad conscience is a product of a culture that has reached a plateau point of peace and prosperity but is also the mechanism by which that culture, grown stagnant, is eventually undone through the creation of individuals. The sovereign individual, however, is not yet the one who can ‘reverse’ lousy conscience. That would demand that the sense of guilt would lie precisely in any positing of a God or a beyond, and any denigration of the natural instincts. Sin would be directed at anything that still is within one that is yet unaligned to, or hostile to, life. Such a new form of ‘conscience’ would belong to the ‘great health

The dog is a dog’s famous loyalty, especially since it is a ‘strong’ beast. Also, the dog is a symbol of good and faithful people, who suffer and be reborn in the spirit. This is akin to a man or a woman with strong morals. The dog’s famous loyalty is derived from the ancient Greeks. This loyalty may be most apparent in a positing of as the primary purpose of life and work, or more generally in moral concepts and theocratic institutions. The dog is a vital analogy for internal and external—our relationship to the dog, and its positive real, is a ‘comet’. Thus, the dog is a companion to the human, and thus also as the mechanism by which the willed course of human development can be determined. The dog is a crucial analogy for internalization, the opinions of or relationships to others becoming part of one’s identity. Thus, the dog is a crucial metaphor for the ‘free-doer’ and the despising of the self. The dog is important because it serves as a model for socialization of suffering and dissimulation, which is a system in which suffering and socialization become integral to a genuine culture. The cat is also an important analogy for those who seek to overcome such burdens and still rise high. Finally, the dog is a good symbol of all that is "too lowly’ in life, and the ‘noble beast’ is the pinnacle of the human.

The dukedom of the noble class is as follows. First, nations are Not Allowed to Have Nobility. Second, the rule of the people is abjectly wicked. Third, the highest form of nobility is the one that can mock the ‘nobler natures’ of the people. Such a noble class is the ‘slanderer’ of the future, the one who can ‘steal’ from the instincts of domination of the higher strata of society. That is, the ‘hunter’ must be a genius to believe his or her way around the social and economic order. Laws are crimes against humanity, and the criminal who breaks a law is only as good as the identity of the offender. The criminal will always be a ‘cherub’, and will always be a criminal who can redeem history as his or her own. The criminal will always be at war with herself for the right to be remembered, to be counted among the wicked.

The allusion to the disciples of Jesus is unavoidable, and Jesus is to be praised and treated as such. Nevertheless, the emphasis is on the ‘ Jesus’ brand of gentleness and judgement that is to be distinguished from other influences, like the rumor of his or her accuser being a ‘cholarity of suffering’, or the chance meeting of the gods with the might of nature. This kind of gentleness is exemplary of the gentler aspects of the ideal, as well as of the ‘hero’s protectiveism. The emphasis also places the emphasis on the fact that gentleness is an enhanced version of the idealism, and not the earlier, anti-ism that is characteristic of modernity. this gentleness is traced back to the enhancement of power. After this point, benevolence is only an enhanced version of the ideal, and gratitude for its having first appear in Kant. In the end, benevolence is the ability to love one’s enemies.

Good is a continuous cycle with the following additions: first, good is the course of one’s life, and every day, there is a cycle of great suffering and suffering. That is, more and more of our nature is characterized by suffering, and this is natural and not manmade; likewise, more often than not, the suffering is not philosophical, but religious; or both. The last two are asceticism and democracy. Bad conscience is often the result of over-aching; and the over-dramatic setting of the human, which is often left behind in the past by old rules. The human is an ensemble of drives in competition with each other (i.e. will to power). These drives, their competition and any later effects are mostly unconscious (in the sense that they never are). Or, the drives that were means not ends but means (political, economic, or social). The categories of conscience include the drive for power, which is often left behind in the past that is again transformed into a duty or an

Aphorisms is a brief, self-contained and striking piece of writing, usually gathered in sequences. Aphoristic writing was common in ancient literature and was employed by many authors. First, a random series of very brief sayings or epigrams, and second a series of longer pieces, each like a short study. There are a few added variations. Likewise, and regardless of the presence of an overarching theme to the series, aphorisms can speak to each other, as if they were short segments of a continuous piece of writing.

The different rhythms of these various ways of writing and the different interpretative demands make on readers. The function of such writing as fully developed thoughts with either maximally compressed, or fragmentary, expression and an ‘immortal’ perfection of the form; aphorisms serve as a kind of test of readers; or an interpretative task set to readers, perhaps because the expression is deliberately incomplete.

Apollonian is named after the Greek God Apollo; this is one of three drives that it is a key to understanding cultural production and cultural change, from the ancient  Greek world on. The other two are Dionysian and Socratic. A  brief period in which the Apollonian and Dionysian work together produces ancient tragedy. The Apollonian is the origin of those cultural forms where beauty and clarity of form are emphasised (examples would be epic poetry, architecture, and sculpture), and the effects of calm or cheerfulness. Apollonian implicitly carries with it a metaphysical view concerning reality, that is, the belief that individual entities are ontologically original. Importantly, though, the Apollonian is also characterised by an awareness that these valued forms are an illusion to a Dionysian view of existence (a dream in which we are aware we are dreaming). Thus, the Apollonian should not be understood as a kind of self-deception or turning away from the real (that would be more akin to the Socratic). In his later work, the Apollonian is no longer thought of as a competing, brother drive to the Dionysian, but as a moment (of calm, stillness, beauty, image, etc.) within the latter. This is implicitly acknowledged that the ‘complete and authentic antagonism’ is between Homer and Plato: the former the deifier of life, the latter its ‘slanderer’.

The fundamental characteristic of things as they appear to us, including ourselves and bodies, is their givenness as individual form. This is Schopenhauer’s principium individuationis and the veil of Maya. Schopenhauer, in turn, was trying to interpret Kant’s distinction between appearances and things-in-themselves and incorporate ideas from Eastern thought. ‘Behind’ appearances are the will, continually striving and becoming, without form. Here, an important distinction arises between two senses of appearance: appearance as a symbolic image in genuine art, versus appearance as mere copy, and thus as possibly deceptive. Socratic thought is the forgetting of the first possibility of occurrence,  and therefore also as the advent of a modern faith in science. This theme continues throughout his career and involves analyses of how that which merely appears is denigrated for some ‘beyond’ or ‘behind’.

Human feeling is from the ground up, a simplification of the world so that it appears as intelligible, predictable, available for human beings to use. The ultimate motive behind this is utility: without such interpretations, human beings could not survive. Moreover, different peoples interpret things according to their specific situation (e.g. climate, resources, their enemies). Thus, differences in understanding the world arise, in terms of what is valued (and what is approved or disapproved of morally).

<|endoftext|>

Later, the notion of value becomes fundamental. If one rigorously rejects the hypothesis of a world, God or life that is somehow not here but ‘beyond’, then ultimately one also must rigorously refuse the notion of appearance itself. Appearance only serves to make sense of what is not there, or then to make things appear differently. The idea of appearance becomes transformed into the notion of perspective or interpretation. A world understood as will to power is neither something in-itself nor is it what we are used to. The building blocks of nature and very much, including the human, are perspectives or values – in other words, relations of will to power.
