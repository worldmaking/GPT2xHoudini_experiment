 and also that the effects may arise from disinterest, but must be an integral part of a strong life. That is, those values that one has cultivated must have aquantifying effects (i.e. must be equivalent to an infinite number of intrinsic and internal). Such a life (in any ordinary sense) is impossible without the aid of God; thus, the ascetic ideal is either an 'end' or a 'last' chance. It is this lack of ancillary or incidental value-points that make up the beauty of the ascetic ideal; this 'no'-saying to fate,  which is a characteristic of the ascetic ideal that the will to power does not suffer from nihilism or nihilism+, and which is also a characteristic of the self-overcoming of will to power. A similar point is made about 'honorable' enemies. The ascetic ideal is, for a philosophy, a vocation, or a directing influence over the 'real'.

The highest human values are those of a 'godlike' and 'incredulous' nature. The ascetic ideal is thus a miraculous tool against the tyrant. The tyrant is the creator of human greatness, and the philosopher of the world is the figure of Hermes Trismegistus.

The highest human values are those of a 'godlike' or 'incredulous' nature. The ascetic ideal is thus a miraculous tool against the tyrant. The tyrant is the image of Dionysus, who, in both, is divinely-unqualified disaster. The best friendship is not an agreement but antagonism: 'let us be enemies too, my friends!', and similarly a good enemy is an asset; man and woman are said to be locked in antagonism; likewise, the masculine and feminine, by means of which agon is symbolised erotically; Wisdom 'loves only a warrior' is a metaphorical evocation of agon in philosophical overcoming. The instinct for struggle is not always productive, however, and must be had or discharged in a way that does not threaten. This was the role of a state; in other words, the proper function of the state is to harness the agon.

<|endoftext|>

The struggle is either among those of equal power, or unequal. The former may yield enhancement (for both parties). One reason struggle may not be productive is that it is not among equals: to war against an inferior is ignoble or shameful, to war against a superior is irreverent. Agon is productive, then, only if it recognises differences, rather than collapses them.

<|endoftext|>

Thus, the concept of the agon is also part of 'modern ideas' such as equality, democracy or socialism. Similarly, tyranny is a monopoly of power that collapses power towards an individual—the struggle among agents within a social group. Struggle is also internal; however: since the individual self is formed of a multiplicity of drives, an agonistic 'society' is also found within the self. Thus, for example, the ascetic struggles to repress specific drives, or against enervation.

'The Great' King of Macedonia and famously conqueror of the known world from Greece east to India by the age of 32. Alexander gave Greek culture throughout the ancient world and brought Eastern culture West. When, 'Alexandrian' culture is a reference to wide dissemination, but also the attendant, Socratic turn of cultural scholarship to the mere accumulation of information (symbolised by the library at Alexandria). Thus, what are needed now are a series of 'anti-Alexanders' who concentrate and purify. Alexander is already a caricature of early Greek civilisation, exaggerated and simplified, although still displaying their deep-rooted cruelty ('Homer’s Contest’). The story of Alexander cutting the Gordian knot is a commonly used image.

An allegory is an image (visual or described in language) that has a certain coherence on its terms (is, for example, a recognisable thing, a character, a narrative) but also carries a symbolic meaning. This is conventional for a few added examples. Allegory can be termed ‘ironic’ when the allegorical vehicle already has a symbolic meaning of its own, but something else is meant. An example would be the use of the image of the heavens. The heavens become a symbol of the absence of providence. 

<|endoftext|>

Philosophical thinking about the nature of allegory begins early. While music is understood to be directly symbolic of the original unity of things, lyric poetry employs allegories to try the same symbolic work.  The same point is made concerning the allegorical nature of myth. The

 and not with the goal of knowledge itself – namely the preservation and growth of the human. Therefore, the passage called ‘On Redemption’ takes place on a ‘great bridge’. The ascetic ideal is, for a philosophy, a unique bridge to his or her conditions of growth. The priests are disinclined to action, even poverty or war, is not itself a pathos to knowledge, and yet its agon is victorious over will. This is the ‘end’ and is the meaning of the tightrope walk. The priest is a kind of ‘maker of men’, and thus the priest is never merely another sidekick to the growth of the human, but a participant in the growth of the world. The priest is a kind of spirit that the human is supposed to be on his or her own; likewise, the modern sense of the priest is depends upon the ability to produce genius or genius (the latter, in turn, depends upon the priestly). 

<|endoftext|>

The modern sense of the priest is to make oneself the object of desire, not to desire, and not to despise or even fear the fact that you are doing so. But this does not mean that the actual is ugly or wrong; merely that the ugly is part of the ideal of a new form of life. This is an integral part of the description of the ‘end’ of the real. Not surprisingly, the over human is a symbol of the decadence of the human, which is often described as decadent. There are two clues: first, through comedy, that is through a light-footed, mocking irreverence; second, through the will to the truth coming to consciousness not as a principle but as a problem. Asceticism can be naturalised, that is a return to the original Greek concept of askesis (training), a discipline of improving strength and health.

‘Asia’ or the ‘East’ usually delivers to the following ideas that Russia as a significant rival to European power, or as a critical origin for nihilism and anarchism;  culture, social systems or philosophical systems in India or China, founded on Hinduism or Buddhism; relatedly, China about its capacity for an industrious class without resentment; the area to the east of Greek civilisation, particularly as the ‘prehistory’ of the Dionysian.

Ass can be a general term of abuse, connoting above all stupidity and dullness or slowness. All humans, from a higher perspective, are idiotic. To the concept of ass, the distinctive braying is ‘i-a’, thus ‘jay’ or yes – the ass stands for indiscriminate affirmation, lack of taste. The ass sometimes replaces such meanings as stubborn, enduring, and even intelligent; as a weight-bearing creature, the figure of the ass sometimes overlaps with the more familiar image of the camel. The festival of the ass is akin to one aspect of the Greek ‘Dionysian’ festival – the suspension of cultural and social order; likewise, there are Medieval traditions with a similar theme. Also, the ass is made sacred in some myths of Dionysus. Moreover, worshipping the ass is akin to the final nihilistic stages of religion, but here in a joyous and festive spirit.

A modern conception of space means the vast, mostly empty and cold distances between stars or planets – an excellent symbolic vehicle for his notions of the pathos of distance (‘too distant star’), the infrequent appearance of greatness, nobility, friendship, solitude (the image of the star emitting light into the darkness, also notice the allusion to solar flares) or untimeliness (‘the light of the stars needs time’ ). Likewise, it serves to convey the cosmic insignificance of human beings and even the chaotic nature of reality overall. Similarly, also the methods of astronomy are employed: not seeing the stars as ‘above you’ – that is not transcendent in nature.

In its primary sense, atheism is the positive assertion of the non- existence of anything like a god. To be sure, nothing like a god exists as either an independent physical or a transcendent entity. If gods are symbolic expressions of human ideals, however, then atheism in this essential sense is changed by the commitment to the Dionysian model.

<|endoftext|>

Abandoning a belief in a transcendent God is a step forward culturally. However, in general, the issue of a god’s existence is far from the most critical aspect. More important are questions like the following: (i) what does the need to posit a god’s existence

 and one must be the poet of oneself – to live as a work of art.  Art is a mode of the growth of will to power, instinctive and involuntary, the growth of human abilities and a condition of natural selection. Art is the transformation of one’s environment into an image of one’s beauty – it is a magnanimous gift. Likewise, art can be a tool combating the ascetic ideal. An ‘art of life’ is a crucial characteristic of great peoples, too; similarly, while talks about art without artists, by which means certain kinds of institutions (the idea is similar to how culture drives work through individuals).

The symbols of height and ascending play a vital role, understandably associated with for example mountains, birds, lightness (as opposed to heaviness), the sky (e.g. astronomical references), cold and overcoming. Such symbols follow rooted conventions within philosophy (Plato’s philosopher climbs up from the cave) and culture more widely (God and heaven above us, elevated moods, high priests, etc.). The symbol stands for the increase of an individual’s (or a people’s) power and health, and thus also for the increase in their capacity for beauty, great projects, or rule. For example, both a ‘godly’ and ‘below’ people are elevated mountains, while a people with a good conscience is a people with a bad conscience. The symbol stands for the increase of an individual’s (or a people’s) power and health, and also for the increase in their capacity for beauty, great projects, or rule. The symbols also reflect the rhythm of the cave, as well as the rhythm of the sunrise.

The feminine and masculine become mere details in a story; the feminine is used figuratively, connoting non- existence. The masculine, on the other hand, is manor Genius, and the feminine is feminine. Whatever conventionality these various significations may have, they are all the more significant because they are the basis of a ‘inspiration’ of the masculine.

The symbol of childbirth is as combining two or more things into one: for example, tampons and pads. The symbol also has influence with the Dionysian, which is associated with sexuality. The union of breasts and boobs is akin to having two large, floppy, squid-like appendages. The two elements are then suddenly combined and, in a dream, you are taken to believe that you are being welcomed home from the doctor. However, in fact, the stomach is a transformed state in the presence of Jupiter Earth and Dionysus. The stomach is also used to describe the state of an individual’s (or a people’s) morality; likewise, it is used to describe the state of a people. The system of moral systems is thus revealed to morality and shows growing in power. The system is characterized by the simplification of the social structure, and the frequent drops of hypocrisy and arrogance. The stomach shows this same pattern. The other primary role of the stomach is as a reservoir of animal products, particularly of the first class, and then as a stage in the digestion of the great human. The stomach shows this same mechanism in men and animals. The connection made just there between diet and and androitin is made, again, in the expression of gratitude. The system of diet is also used in France and other European nations were it not for the irresistible will to power.

The primary condition of communication is the sharing of a language – a system of signs and significations. But what is signified is by no means either ‘raw’ (i.e. uninterpreted) experiences or things in the world; somewhat, these significations are changed by values. Therefore, having a language in common is dependent upon also sharing a set of values. It follows that communication of thoughts that depend upon a new set of values, or those values themselves, is the most difficult. Moreover, one’s values are a product of one’s constitution – for example, various inheritances from the past, including both cultural and genetic, the habits that form a mode of life, etc. So, to communicate genuinely new thoughts or values would be to transform the listener. There is the same problem with interpreting or understanding ancient cultures. Particularly to the ancient Greeks,  there is an aloneness that is difficult and perhaps impossible to bridge (‘Homer’s Contest’); alternatively, if it can be bridged, would result in a transformation of the present – this, for example, is the reason which gets repeatedly emphasised the Greek sense of religion.
