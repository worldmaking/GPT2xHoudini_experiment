Conscience is one's sense that what one is doing is the 'right' or 'wrong' thing; the concept applies whatever the sphere of action is (intellectual, practical, moral) and whatever standard of right or wrong is relevant. For example, despite temptations, the rigorous seeker after truth cannot return to romanticism or Christianity without 'dirtying' his or her intellectual conscience. Conscience can be individual, or some group can act as the conscience of an age. Not surprisingly, conscience is often associated with honesty. The idea seems to be that a good conscience is the alignment of the maxims of one's action with the growth of higher culture, of the feeling of power or the human type. This notion of conscience is an old-fashioned one.

To not adopt a questioning attitude, especially to moral questions, to not even be interested, proves neither an excellent nor lousy conscience but a lack of conscience. Here is an example of a lack of conscience that the play-actor only believes in what he can convince others of. His or her beliefs are thus reactive, and changeable depending upon the audience. We are too 'comfortable' to have resolute convictions, and therefore happily chop and change our views. We are incapable even of hypocrisy or bad intellectual conscience. If a conscience at all, the philosopher who looks to find reasons for what he or she already believes would have an evil conscience.

It is possible for conscience to be corrupted. For example, through a morality of custom, creativity buys a bad conscience – that is to say, the conscience of the social group has been internalized. Similarly, habits of obedience in a people can lead to even the commanders having a bad conscience at having to command, and masking this by pretending to follow still higher rules. The opposite movement, namely the acquisition of the ability to contradict established customs with a good conscience. Thus, the concept of the ‘intellectual conscience’, defined as the ‘conscience behind your “conscience”’, and which is precisely the ability to question one’s habits, and the customs or beliefs of one’s age.

The most sustained treatment of the theme of the genesis of conscience is presented in the Treatise of GM - that the aim here is to explore the sovereign individual, with ‘power over oneself and fate’. This idea of having a ‘long, unbreakable will’ relates to the frequent criticism of bad conscience in the sense of regretting an. But this is a ‘late’ fruit, and much of the treatise concerns preliminary stages: the breeding of the concepts of guilt and punishment from out of the debt of legal subjects and the cruelty involved in the redemption of debt. Bad conscience is initially the state of the higher human being – one whose animal part has not been entirely bred out – in society when no outlet for his or her instincts remains. It is defined as a directing against oneself of these higher instincts and desire for power; equivalently, it is a joy in the disciplined formation of oneself. Here it is not the result of an internalization of external values, but a sense that one is being is in some way defective to one is ideal. From this lousy conscience arises a sense of debt to God, a debt that could never be repaid except by a sacrifice of God on the cross. Also, this lousy conscience is both a ‘sickness’ and ‘full of future’. That is, bad conscience is a product of a culture that has reached a plateau point of peace and prosperity but is also the mechanism by which that culture, grown stagnant, is eventually undone through the creation of individuals. The sovereign individual, however, is not yet the one who can ‘reverse’ lousy conscience. That would demand that the sense of guilt would lie precisely in any positing of a God or a beyond, and any denigration of the natural instincts. Sin would be directed at anything that still is within one that is yet unaligned to, or hostile to, life. Such a new form of ‘conscience’ would belong to the ‘great health’.

A traditional definition of consciousness is that part or function of us that not only thinks, feels, and acts but is aware of itself doing so and can reflect upon it. Because of that awareness, consciousness also implies the ability to will its thinking, acting and even to some extent, its feeling. Accordingly, consciousness is our critique of will and our evaluation of the human subject as a causal agent so that the emphasis placed on consciousness within modern thought (Descartes, Kant, and German Idealism) is

 place in a continuum, an ideal system that was stable, and therefore also  enduringly true. Moreover,  here, the distinction between a vast quantum of power, and a small class of ‘infidels who can be powerful and become mere drops of dirty blood, is deeply cynical. Regarding the infamous ‘Dionysian’ speech delivered by the tyrant Silenes, who refuses to give up the struggle for existence, Ja'far jeeringlynotes this is to affirm his sovereign right to the ‘tape of the cat’ to his catskneeling at the command of the tyrant. The cat is a metaphor for the self-determining discipline of one's instincts, of which the cat is no exception.

The notion of the impotence of 'City' can be found in 'antiquarian' history, which is associated with cities. Such account at best serves life only as preservation and not creation but, at worst, 'mummifies' life. The city is also associated with the 'mob'. It is this weak and isolated position that is the 'struggle' against the law – an idea dear to Kant. The city is also associated with decadence and with the lack of a ‘redeem’ of suffering.

Apollonian is named after the Greek God Apollo; this is one of three drives that it is a key to understanding cultural production and cultural change, from the ancient  Greek world on. The other two are Dionysian and Socratic. A  brief period in which the Apollonian and Dionysian work together produces ancient tragedy. The Apollonian is the origin of those cultural forms where beauty and clarity of form are emphasised (examples would be epic poetry, architecture, and sculpture), and the effects of calm or cheerfulness. Apollonian implicitly carries with it a metaphysical view concerning reality, that is, the belief that individual entities are ontologically original. Importantly, though, the Apollonian is also characterised by an awareness that these valued forms are an illusion to a Dionysian view of existence (a dream in which we are aware we are dreaming). Thus, the Apollonian should not be understood as a kind of self-deception or turning away from the real (that would be more akin to the Socratic). In his later work, the Apollonian is no longer thought of as a competing, brother drive to the Dionysian, but as a moment (of calm, stillness, beauty, image, etc.) within the latter. This is implicitly acknowledged that the ‘complete and authentic antagonism’ is between Homer and Plato: the former the deifier of life, the latter its ‘slanderer’.

The fundamental characteristic of things as they appear to us, including ourselves and bodies, is their givenness as individual form. This is Schopenhauer’s principium individuationis and the veil of Maya. Schopenhauer, in turn, was trying to interpret Kant’s distinction between appearances and things-in-themselves and incorporate ideas from Eastern thought. ‘Behind’ appearances are the will, continually striving and becoming, without form. Here, an important distinction arises between two senses of appearance: appearance as a symbolic image in genuine art, versus appearance as mere copy, and thus as possibly deceptive. Socratic thought is the forgetting of the first possibility of occurrence,  and therefore also as the advent of a modern faith in science. This theme continues throughout his career and involves analyses of how that which merely appears is denigrated for some ‘beyond’ or ‘behind’.

Human feeling is from the ground up, a simplification of the world so that it appears as intelligible, predictable, available for human beings to use. The ultimate motive behind this is utility: without such interpretations, human beings could not survive. Moreover, different peoples interpret things according to their specific situation (e.g. climate, resources, their enemies). Thus, differences in understanding the world arise, in terms of what is valued (and what is approved or disapproved of morally).

Later, the notion of value becomes fundamental. If one rigorously rejects the hypothesis of a world, God or life that is somehow not here but ‘beyond’, then ultimately one also must rigorously refuse the notion of appearance itself. Appearance only makes sense to something ‘behind’ or

 place as an abyss: everything that is, for example, the ground of reality and illusion. Reality thus becomes ‘the enemy of my self-overcoming’.

A traditional definition of consciousness is that part or function of us that not only thinks, feels, and acts but is aware of itself doing so and can reflect upon it. Because of that awareness, consciousness also implies the ability to will its thinking, acting and even to some extent, its feeling. Accordingly, consciousness is our critique of will and our evaluation of the human subject as a causal agent so that the emphasis placed on consciousness within modern thought (Descartes, Kant, and German Idealism) is an enormous error. Leibniz usually gets cited as an exception, since the latter posited unconscious Petite's feelings as an essential factor in human identity and motivation. So, for example, the consciousness of one’s fate can lead to unconscious pity for the misunderstood. Similarly, consciousness is the ability to affirm one’s fate, which is to say to be able to love and serve. Affirmation, in other words, is a way of people, places, or people types. It is also the strategy for ressentiment and, in turn, the concept of transformation. Accordingly, consciousness is the unconditional love of and gratitude towards the earth.

Affirmation is second only to desire or knowledge. Indeed, the best description of happiness is not so much a feeling of power but of being contented and loving and having a good conscience about the world. The affirming of one’s fate is an affirmation of being, and not just one itself. Affirmation is also used as a mechanism for comforting. At the root of all that is painful is the life of consciousness. That is, a dangerous form of life, one that stays true to itself and its condition by pretending not to understand itself. Thus, one cannot live a affirming affirmation even if it is an able affirmation. Affirmation is the key figure among the Vedanta.

Aristotle accounts the relation of tragedy to the chorus in ‘Greek Music Drama’; likewise, with the grand idea of the catharsis of pity and fear. Aristotle is a product of the decay of Greek culture: thus, despite his careful consideration of earlier philosophers, he has no real understanding of their greatness or creative power. The function of Aristotle is to Aristotle, and likewise, to many other ancient and medieval philosophers for elucidating the reasons for the decline of tragedy. The same is true of Aristotle here. Aristotle is a product of the decline of Greek culture: thus, despite his careful consideration of earlier philosophers, he has no real understanding of the greatness of the natural philosopher Epicurus. This contrast is not just a designation of the problem; it is a critical assessment. Significantly, there is no renunciation of the idea of Aristotle here. The novel contrast between theserious and the anti-antiquarian. The former is about as far fetched as trying to avoid it, and themore resolute and courageous it is, the more resolute it is. The atheistic strand is pessimistic, nihilistic, or as a consequence a form of creation. In contrast, the atheistic is often positive, with an emphasis placed upon the importance of innocence and the innocent course of life. The positive aspect of the atheistic is that it offers a more natural and acceptable form of life. The harmful aspect is that itises an ideal that is illusory. In a positive sense, this is the opposite of the purpose of this book: merely to present and defend the positive aspect of the Greek concept of atheism.

The emphasis of cleverness on the value of slaves is a point which is often used that cleverness is a qualification for the post-exilic period (i.e. the evaluation of the beauty of self-overcoming), and the period of pure cultural development when individuals and even nations alike, are able to ‘give’ themselves away. The idea is that the pathos of gentleness and self-respect is a valuable vehicle for this purpose, and that its achievement be celebrated. This kind of cleverness is not difficult. The idea is that making self-respect a condition of life, or of work. The ideal cleverness is highest when pursued at the level of an achievement of the highest character. This is the ‘despising’ against which we are led to’ be able to crush the strength of greatness. The greatest of greatness are
