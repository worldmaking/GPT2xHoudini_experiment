 of the human; also, could ‘redeem’ the past and present as if it were a product of their will, could genuinely love one’s fate. As such, accident, or chance (in any ordinary sense) is not relevant. Likewise, necessity is no cause for distress, for nothing can befall the lover of fate that is not also a product of the creative will.

Several thinkers argued that any hierarchical framework of political, economic, legal, or social power must be harmful to human beings. Also, revolutionary figures and groups in the nineteenth century and beyond believed that political institutions could not be reformed but had to be dismantled. Although Rousseau was not an anarchist, some aspects of his thinking were essential for later anarchist thought. 

Although anarchism appears to be intellectually opposed to other modern ideas such as democracy, equality or even socialism, is in fact of a piece with them. Anarchism is founded on reaction and ressentiment, remains moralistic, expresses a fundamental belief in the value of pity, or instead a fundamental inability not to feel shame, and finally evidences a desire for the herd. Early Christians were anarchistic; likewise, emancipated women. Some anarchists are individuals of high power, but that power expresses itself in self-denial and pure destruction.

Animal defers to tier, and with different connotations, Bestie. In general, it is the figure of animality to describe aspects of the human, for example, virtues, vices, drives or types. Sometimes, however, there will be a unique twist or inversion of meanings or values.

However, 'animal' does not only indicate about types of animals but animality more generally. First, 'animal' stands for a conception of humanity that tries to reintegrate the human into the broader natural world. The human has been falsely differentiated. It was countered with an 'honest', even scientific, characterisation of the human-animal. Second, 'animal' is the figure of that creature guided by instinct rather than by reason or conscious deliberation, and thus also whose abilities may be healthy rather than repressed or distorted through domestication or guilt before God. Third, the animal can mean that aspect of the human which does or should cause shame, which has not reached to that type of nobility that is distinctively human.

Finally, the animal kingdom is one where differences (such as those along the food chain) are an integral part of a healthy system. This is a commentary on the necessity in human affairs of class or caste; and, a claim about the will to power as a fundamental description of life. The notion of the beast of prey or the infamous image of the ‘blond beast’ belongs here. Notice that the beast of prey image is by no means always a positive one: on what and how it preys, and with what good conscience, is the difference. While culture and the state begin with the ‘blond beast’, the further development of the human type will occur through ‘bad conscience’ – a phenomenon utterly impossible for that beast.

'Ant' defers to the symbol of work, especially industrial, as part of a homogeneous group. Also, it means small, incremental and in-themselves blind contributions and likewise a necessarily limited or fragmentary view of purposes or projects.

Anthropomorphism means to impose the form or qualities of the human onto something. The innumerable ways in which the histories of science, philosophy or religion have involved anthropomorphism. A key example is the concept of cause and effect in nature that this separation of cause and effect is an anthropomorphism, founded upon what is already a false characterisation of human action in terms of will. The whole of our knowledge of the world (including human beings) is anthropomorphic.

On the one hand, then, these anthropomorphisms are illegitimate (they are ‘lies’), despite their enormous utility for human beings. On the other hand, there stays a danger of the destruction of culture through the overemphasis on critique (historicism, specialisation, etc.). The generation of greatness, the flourishing and advancement of the human depend upon such ‘lies’ being productive in the realm of culture.

Anti-Semitism is a symptom of a weak and defensive culture, of ressentiment, of nationalism and of a form of asceticism that demands stimulation.

'Antichrist, The' should be understood more as ‘Anti-Christian’ and tightly focused on the psychological and physiological meanings of the advent, growth, and triumph of Christianity, in comparison, especially with Buddhism. Notable for a sustained, speculative, and

 of the concept of allegory. In all these cases, human practices or institutions that may have utility on their terms, but which gain much of their significance from their allegorical meaning.

It is repeated that all permanence is a poet’s allegory, and the poets lie too much. All that is transient is merely allegory’. ‘Poet’ here does not only mean an artist in verse, but also anyone who posits permanence (the metaphysics of substance, or the theology of a god), since that is only a poetic device. Such lying allegories are not contrasted to any direct, non- poetic statement of facts. A model of language that values clarity, directness and the absence of imagery is even further from the capacity to speak the truths of, say, will to power. Instead, the contrast is with ‘higher’ allegories of time and becoming. Here, on every allegory, you ride to every truth. Similarly, only in dance can we tell the allegory of the highest things. Something like ‘inspiration’, then, is needed for such images to cease being a lie and reach to their proper symbolic functioning.

The love of one’s fate, specifically, a gratitude towards all that makes up the situation that I inhabit, and which has produced me in the way that I am. The root of the idea is found in the notion of ‘antiquarian history’. The interconnectedness of all things and events, this ‘all’ is effectively the whole course of history as far as that history ‘passes’, in part, through an individual. Amor fati is a ‘formula for greatness’. My love or gratitude comes from the fact that this fate produces me and does so as being capable of affirming myself and capable of having a creative role in the future.

The idea is closely allied to that of affirmation more generally:  to say yes to this situation is the only way of saying yes to oneself, and vice versa. It is related to the affirmation of eternal recurrence. Only an individual who embodied a healthy and ascending life; was spiritually attuned to such life (e.g. not deceived about themselves); also, could ‘redeem’ the past and present as if it were a product of their will, could genuinely love one’s fate. As such, accident, or chance (in any ordinary sense) is not relevant. Likewise, necessity is no cause for distress, for nothing can befall the lover of fate that is not also a product of the creative will.

The notion of democracy is inclusive, as any mode of thought that ascribes homogeneity or uniformity to the real. In political thought, therefore, democracy involves the passing of power to the masses and conceptions such as equality of rights or moral value. The political conceptions of democracy parallel the accounts of herd morality and nobility. Therefore, the concept of democracy, at least act as a provisional instrument for stability and the overcoming of militarized nationalism. Following its in-deep idea, a ‘future democracy’ is characterized by independence of opinion, and modes of life and employment. This future form is distinguished from current forms, such as parliamentarians. The democratic ideal is also considered as that which breaks up rigid class hierarchies. It thus liberates individual ambition, although at the cost of a collective and enduring sense of the future, of the executive power of the group, and productive differences. Democracy produces a people incapable of command and is in danger of falling prey to a tyrant.

Importantly, though, that first broad definition of democracy means that it influences non-political domains. The democracy of concepts whereby modernity considers anyone as ill who is single-minded; the democratic notion of universal natural law; or the democratic prejudice that now pervades science and eliminates one of the basic concepts of life, genuine activity.

Depth has several meanings. First, depth describes the more interesting or revealing rule (i.e. those who are not among the great and noble), as opposed to the exception. Second, that which is ‘below’ the superficial, especially conventional interpretations of psychological phenomena. Third, similarly, some people or peoples are ‘profound’ as opposed to those who are only superficial. Partly because interesting and revealing, depth is often the necessary precondition or accompaniment of height and ascent.

Descartes is a seventeenth-century French philosopher. His importance is being first in the line of ‘modern’ philosophers who offer a critique of the Christian concept of soul. Similarly, Descartes’ idea that animals are biological machines is praised, as well as Descartes as a psychologist. Nevertheless, Descartes’ faith in the immediate integrity of self-reflection is a frequent target.

Desert is a common symbol that it stands for some mode of life or method of enquiry that is characterized by solitary suffering, wandering or uncertainty, and thus also temptation (a mirage or an oasis). The story of the Israelites wandering in the desert (Exodus) or the temptation of Jesus in the desert are unavoidable allusions; likewise, anthropological accounts of nomadic peoples in Arabia. For examples, the camel tests its strength in the desert, the lion becomes lord of its desert so that the symbol of desert presents a comic song of moral and sexual temptation in an oasis. This symbol relates closely to several others, including the south and wandering.

There are several related concepts about 'despising' with four different broad uses can be found.

The despising of the self. Christian self-despising arises from out of the impossibility of living up to the ideal of selfless acts, especially in the 'brilliant mirror' that is God's selflessness; similarly, to feel contented with some aspect of him or herself, the Christian must despise some other part. Such self-hatred creates an artistic 'need' of a lower kind: a narcotic to disguise one's discontentment. Hatred for the self can be externalized in an act (real or imaginary) of revenge. On the other side, it is essential to be well disposed towards oneself to avoid one's actions being determined by reaction or ressentiment. Reverence for the self is thus a noble trait.

The despising of the master. In a psychological inversion, which is also called ‘ressentiment’, those individuals or peoples who were enslaved (literally or metaphorically) created a value system from out of their hatred of their masters. Whatever characteristics the masters had, these would now be called ‘evil’; the features of the slaves (meekness, poverty, etc.) would be called ‘good’. Thus, the inversion of the ancient view that work is contemptible. Significantly, there has a clear distinction between the ‘hatred’ of the slaves and the ‘despising’ of the noble class. At the root of the latter is the ‘feeling of happiness in oneself’. 

The ‘great despising’. The idea is that the human being, as far as of fixed character and resistant
