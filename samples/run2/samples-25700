 ascocratic) moral values, and which sees the whole of life as a total waste of human life and which wants to transform the whole of life into a greatness. The ‘great healthy’ will also be the ‘great selfishness’. The devil has its ‘closest things’, and thus the one that is most closely aligned to the will. Thus, the devil is both Joshua´s way of living and the way that Greeks were often hit by a heavy object and not understand how they got there. The devil, in this case, is the ‘closest things to the good people’. The devil, then, is neither merely the ‘great devil’, but the ‘sick people’ to the ‘evil’.

France and the West have been trying to reverse this point for 20 years or more. The earth makes up only about a third of global present levels by the mid-century, and most of this has been achieved by the very nature of claiming that the earth is merely the vast, flat, flat flat flat flat flat and everything else is a product of human thought or practice.

'Antichrist, The' should be understood more as ‘Anti-Christian’ and tightly focused on the psychological and physiological meanings of the advent, growth, and triumph of Christianity, in comparison, especially with Buddhism. Notable for a sustained, speculative, and positive psychological interpretation of  Jesus,  as akin to a  Buddhist.  It revolves around the contrast between this Jesus and the Christ figure disastrously generated by the Church Fathers, especially Paul.

The ape, then, is either an origin or disfigured mirror-image, of which we are ashamed. The ape is an imitator, unaware even of being an imitator, and which brings disrepute to the imitated.

Aphorisms is a brief, self-contained and striking piece of writing, usually gathered in sequences. Aphoristic writing was common in ancient literature and was employed by many authors. First, a random series of very brief sayings or epigrams, and second a series of longer pieces, each like a short study. There are a few added variations. Likewise, and regardless of the presence of an overarching theme to the series, aphorisms can speak to each other, as if they were short segments of a continuous piece of writing. 

The different rhythms of these various ways of writing and the different interpretative demands make on readers. The function of such writing as fully developed thoughts with either maximally compressed, or fragmentary, expression and an ‘immortal’ perfection of the form; aphorisms serve as a kind of test of readers; or an interpretative task set to readers, perhaps because the expression is deliberately incomplete.

Apollonian is named after the Greek God Apollo; this is one of three drives that it is a key to understanding cultural production and cultural change, from the ancient  Greek world on. The other two are Dionysian and Socratic. A  brief period in which the Apollonian and Dionysian work together produces ancient tragedy. The Apollonian is the origin of those cultural forms where beauty and clarity of form are emphasised (examples would be epic poetry, architecture, and sculpture), and the effects of calm or cheerfulness. Apollonian implicitly carries with it a metaphysical view concerning reality, that is, the belief that individual entities are ontologically original. Importantly, though, the Apollonian is also characterised by an awareness that these valued forms are an illusion to a Dionysian view of existence (a dream in which we are aware we are dreaming). Thus, the Apollonian should not be understood as a kind of self-deception or turning away from the real (that would be more akin to the Socratic). In his later work, the Apollonian is no longer thought of as a competing, brother drive to the Dionysian, but as a moment (of calm, stillness, beauty, image, etc.) within the latter. This is implicitly acknowledged that the ‘complete and authentic antagonism�

 ascetic or nihilistic states that include cruelty or destructiveness. One of the meanings of the ‘evil’ principle is ‘antiquarian’.

Zarathustra calls humans ‘the cruellest beast’ and brings together several forms of cruelty: the pleasure at the suffering of others, the desire involved in the ascetic denigration of life and the cruelty in self-overcoming. The final item on this list certainly includes the cruelty to one’s intellectual conscience engaged in the pursuit of knowledge. The point is elaborated: having internalized existing values and traditions, the philosopher (discoverer of knowledge or creator of values) must be first cruel against him or herself. All these forms of cruelty, from the passive to the reactive, and on to the most active and internal, bring with them a feeling of power. These types of cruelty return more explicitly as the three stages of ‘religious cruelty’, culminating in nihilism – the sacrifice of God ‘for nothing’. Importantly, though, it is more obvious that by pursuing such cruelty to its conclusion that an ‘opposite ideal’ can reveal itself: namely, that form of human beings who can joyously affirm his or her existence.

‘Culture’ means a form of life that people has set up for itself. This culture encapsulates their values, is what allows people both to have an identity and to reproduce and reinforce that identity over time, and which also allows people to produce excellence or greatness. The concept of culture can be used broadly, to designate types of culture that span dozens of nations and hundreds of years (e.g. ‘Alexandrian’ or ‘Hellenic’); or narrowly, to discuss individual peoples or sub-groups (such as ‘noble culture’ ). Culture includes everything from mundane practices (e.g. diet, daily routines), through institutions (church, military, education) up to ‘high’ culture (literature and art).

Culture is thought of as the variety of ways that the underlying Will has of keeping a people alive, and especially stimulating or tricking ‘nobler natures’ who feel the burden of being. There has a distinguish between an authentic and an inauthentic (or dispersed) culture, and similarly between lower and higher. Authentic culture can be defined as one that is unified, and which still serves a vital purpose of all culture, which is to produce genius or greatness. The dispersion of culture happens through the influence of the drive for knowledge, especially historical knowledge, which eventually turns culture into a mere patchwork of styles or practices borrowed randomly from the past, and without the dynamism to take on future projects. The Socratic drive for knowledge cannot be eliminated; instead, the task of culture is to incorporate it into a unity. This concern associates understanding the integration of culture and aids its development in modernity.

Furthermore, the concept of culture also becomes aligned to the conception of power but stays similar in essential respects. Higher culture comprises the feeling of power and the growth of power; indeed, higher culture always begins with barbarians, perhaps with contempt for and the destruction of a previous decadent culture, but in any case with the ‘lust for power’ and cruelty with a good conscience. Cultural advances depend upon power differences and the ‘pathos of distance’; in turn, this means that culture is a ‘pyramid’ with a broad base of workers. Contrasted to higher culture is one based on various forms of physical or spiritual narcotization or making ill (the ‘madhouses of culture’). It is this lack of a future, a lack of awareness that there could or should be future possibilities, that causes deeply disturbing.

In the beginning, Zarathustra calls himself ‘cunning’ when he refuses to reveal that he is using the honey as bait for the higher men. Such cunning, that is, has entered the philosopher’s ‘fishing tackle’ as serving his or her comprehensive responsibility for the development of humans into the future. This becomes explicit that where ‘perhaps’ cunning provides more favourable conditions than scholarship for the development of the philosopher – and again, the following section where cunning is the ‘kindness’ behind the mask. 

Cunning is also associated with the ability to find a way to preserve a diseased or decadent life. These two usages are not in contradiction but are a recognition of the amoral truth that not all battles can be fought in the open, with displays of force.

 asceticism or atheism. From this denigration arise certain ascetic practices that seek to repress the body. To these counterpoises a ‘deification of the body’, the ‘development of a higher body’. Regarding the body, the ‘great despising’ is found the ‘great despising’ of the child. Instead, there is a careful, self-taughtness about the different types of despising. There is a similar turn of where benevolence is a symptom of a system of power, or a cause that is behind a phenomenon. The ‘great despising’ is also the period of decadence when beauty is the ‘spirit of gravity’, and the cycle of decadence and growth of power. This despising of the ‘spirit of gravity’ is not a ‘bad’ despising, but a ‘great’ achievement.

It is positing new ideals and living in the future because of them that is beautiful. The idea is that disputing these values would be a dangerous thing, as long as there is a belief in self-destruction or the self. Thus, creating a future is a way of the self in the past, justifying this by claiming that this moment can return to reveal the ‘beautiful’ behind the mask. This is often described with metaphors of healing from illnesses. The idea is that creating a future are both a way of saying 'no' and justifying it by saying that this moment is the 'perfect moment' of creative creation.

Comprehensiveness is a concept without a single term to name it. Comprehensiveness describes an individual who encompasses and can employ a variety of different states, drives or types of knowledge. Thus, comprehensiveness stands especially in contrast to the specialization typical of modern intellectual life. Comprehensiveness also describes an individual who is well disposed towards his or her condition and is able to influence it. Thus, comprehensiveness is related to the disposition to have certain characteristics (e.g. an ideal child that is disposed towards by his or her life). 

Comprehensiveness is also associated with the ability for irregular or irregular health and any ability to function effectively as a result. Thus, the over human, the animal or some other such ‘eternal being’. Comprehensiveness also describes the ability for the ‘antiquarian’ condition to work its magic. Thus, the over human as Dionysian is contrasted to the ‘spirit of gravity’.

Comprehensiveness is also associated with the ability for creative or inventive past and present, and any future. Thus, the over human as Dionysian is contrasted to the ‘spirit of gravity’. Comprehensiveness is also associated with the ability for the ‘great despising’. Thus, the over human as Dionysian is contrasted to the ‘spirit of gravity’. Comprehensiveness is associated with the ability for the ‘great despising’ of God. Thus, the over human is the one who can not read and cannot speak English, has no ideas beyond a blank sheet of writing, and is incapable of thought other than that of cause and effect. Thus, the over human as the ‘spirit of gravity’ is contrasted to the ‘spirit of despising’ of God. Comprehensiveness is associated with the ascetic ideal. This ideal is a type of comprehensiveness that tries to repress or overcome one’s previous impossibility. Comprehensiveness is associated with the emergence of the rational. For example, the ability for living things to understand one’s present situation, followed then with the famous phrase ‘what a piece of work it is’. Comprehensiveness is associated with the reduction of effort to so- called ‘dirt’ and the discovery of new worlds. Such a god is also compared to Jesus. 

There are three levels of comprehensiveness. First, the non- comprehensiveness, where as comprehensiveness is the highest form of thought, or comprehensiveness is the comprehensiveness of the periodical writer. Second, there are two modes of view about what is comprehensiveness or what is ‘conceptualized’. Third, there are two modes of thinking about culture and the state of their culture – the rational and the ‘rational’ class. The idea is that inland culture is comprehensible, while its culture is not. The concept of culture is inclusive, though not necessarily in kind. If oneorter culture in Schopenhauer’s The Birds is repeated many times that there is a continuum, it is because of the continual addition of words by Bachofen to the Reims which is a product of the emphasis placed on the reproducibility of sounds. Likewise, the relationship between art and philosophy – both require the use of metaphors – is not
