 bottom of a noble or prominent place; thus, it is both suddenly exalted and suddenly free; likewise, the ideal of the nobility arises which is opposite the original hope of asceticism to all humanity. The idea of freedom is an essential historical condition for a world capable of pity and growth. Analogously, the idea of a future one where harmony and beauty arise without the need to posit a great danger (future happiness and joy in the family) is possible; this possibility is reconciliation with the capacity for passion. The idea of a paradox is also worth reflecting: on the level of opinion, which can be decisive in the life of an idea, being considered cruel or productive of degeneration. Such a discussion links to the next question.

Anthropomorphism means to impose the form or qualities of the human onto something. The innumerable ways in which the histories of science, philosophy or religion have involved anthropomorphism. A key example is the concept of cause and effect in nature that this separation of cause and effect is an anthropomorphism, founded upon what is already a false characterisation of human action in terms of will. The whole of our knowledge of the world (including human beings) is anthropomorphic.

On the one hand, then, these anthropomorphisms are illegitimate (they are ‘lies’), despite their enormous utility for human beings. On the other hand, there stays a danger of the destruction of culture through the overemphasis on critique (historicism, specialisation, etc.). The generation of greatness, the flourishing and advancement of the human depend upon such ‘lies’ being productive in the realm of culture.

'Antichrist, The' should be understood more as ‘Anti-Christian’ and tightly focused on the psychological and physiological meanings of the advent, growth, and triumph of Christianity, in comparison, especially with Buddhism. Notable for a sustained, speculative, and positive psychological interpretation of  Jesus,  as akin to a  Buddhist.  It revolves around the contrast between this Jesus and the Christ figure disastrously generated by the Church Fathers, especially Paul.

Ape primate as akin to the animal aspect of humans’ pre-dates Darwin; with Darwin thought arises the notion of a common evolutionary ancestor. The ape, then, is either an origin or disfigured mirror-image, of which we are ashamed. The ape is an imitator, unaware even of being an imitator, and which brings disrepute to the imitated.

Aphorisms is a brief, self-contained and striking piece of writing, usually gathered in sequences. Aphoristic writing was common in ancient literature and was employed by many authors. First, a random series of very brief sayings or epigrams, and second a series of longer pieces, each like a short study. There are a few added variations. Likewise, and regardless of the presence of an overarching theme to the series, aphorisms can speak to each other, as if they were short segments of a continuous piece of writing. 

The different rhythms of these various ways of writing and the different interpretative demands make on readers. The function of such writing as fully developed thoughts with either maximally compressed, or fragmentary, expression and an ‘immortal’ perfection of the form; aphorisms serve as a kind of test of readers; or an interpretative task set to readers, perhaps because the expression is deliberately incomplete.

Apollonian is named after the Greek God Apollo; this is one of three drives that it is a key to understanding cultural production and cultural change, from the ancient  Greek world on. The other two are Dionysian and Socratic. A  brief period in which the Apollonian and Dionysian work together produces ancient tragedy. The Apollonian is the origin of those cultural forms where beauty and clarity of form are emphasised (examples would be epic poetry, architecture, and sculpture), and the effects of calm or cheerfulness. Apollonian implicitly carries with it a metaphysical view concerning reality, that is, the belief that individual entities are ontologically original. Importantly, though, the Apollonian is also characterised by an awareness that these valued forms are an illusion to a Dionysian view of existence (a dream in which we are aware we are dreaming). Thus, the Apollonian should not be understood as a kind of self-deception or turning away from the real (that would be more akin to the Socratic). In his later work, the

 bottom or ‘small’. Art can be a tool and outlet for the self-doubt of the untimeliness of the stage, which can appeased with ‘love of the spectacle’.

True art is both token and saviour of authentically unified culture – by way of discovery and employment of the myths that unify a people. Art is also the destination of post-Enlightenment critical science. In the first phase, everything revolves around tragedy, that art is the pinnacle of ancient Greek culture, as a mechanism for achieving insight into psychological and metaphysical realities and sees as the means of rehabilitation of modernity. Analyses of other genres, such as lyric poetry, epic, or modern opera, are all treated as contributing to the understanding of tragedy. Likewise, if art in modernity deviates from the Greek conception, it serves only as a narcotic, at best a temporary relief from the fragmentation of culture and art forms. This duality of real (Greek or tragic) art – and the broader culture that goes with it – and degenerate, modern art, is a central theme.

In the second phase, we find a sceptical or even damning view taken. The age of art is over, once and for all—art and science in a different opposition and order of priority.  Art is not a route to insight or knowledge, and indeed depends upon a certain ignorance or positing of metaphysical falsehoods. The notion that art protects or soothes stays, but this is not understood as culturally productive; instead, it is a dangerous narcotic.  The development in the modernity of symbolic and de-sensualised media affects both art and the economy. An example is the modern promotion of the spectacle of a dead body in a cave. Art is thus given a value – an authentic portrayal of reality – rather than as a sign of health or courage, or indeed as nobility or vitality of self-respect. Art is only spiritually important if it can be loved, is not just a state of mind – which it is not, but a sense of guilt – but also a sense of still further creation (theic illness or sova).

The love of one’s fate, specifically, a gratitude towards all that makes up the situation that I inhabit, and which has produced me in the way that I am. The root of the idea is found in the notion of ‘antiquarian history’. The interconnectedness of all things and events, this ‘all’ is effectively the whole course of history as far as that history ‘passes’, in part, through an individual. Amor fati is a ‘formula for greatness’. My love or gratitude comes from the fact that this fate produces me and does so as being capable of affirming myself and capable of having a creative role in the future.

The idea is closely allied to that of affirmation more generally:  to say yes to this situation is the only way of saying yes to oneself, and vice versa. It is related to the affirmation of eternal recurrence. Only an individual who embodied a healthy and ascending life; was spiritually attuned to such life (e.g. not deceived about themselves); also, could ‘redeem’ the past and present as if it were a product of their will, could genuinely love one’s fate. As such, accident, or chance (in any authentic sense) is not relevant. Likewise, necessity is no cause for distress, for nothing can befall the lover of fate that is not also a product of the creative will.

Several thinkers argued that any hierarchical framework of political, economic, legal, or social power must be harmful to human beings. Also, revolutionary figures and groups in the nineteenth century and beyond believed that political institutions could not be reformed but had to be dismantled. Although Rousseau was not an anarchist, some aspects of his thinking were essential for later anarchist thought. 

Although anarchism appears to be intellectually opposed to other modern ideas such as democracy, equality or even socialism, is in fact of a piece with them. Anarchism is founded on reaction and ressentiment, remains moralistic, expresses a fundamental belief in the value of pity, or instead a fundamental inability not to feel shame, and finally evidences a desire for the herd. Early Christians were anarchistic; likewise, emancipated women. Some anarchists are individuals of high power, but that power expresses itself in self-denial and pure destruction.

More importantly, it is also part of the mechanism by which culture and the state interact – by creating symbols – and thus by which mechanism is at work. So, for example, the ‘man of intuition’ created the record in the distance, and that which is truth is the ‘dictator of history’. Likewise, Lies and Tragedy are two of the most common forms of questioning the nature of time.

The devil is a frequent object of hatred in and of itself. The first one is the notion of the spirit of gravity or of attraction, the second the various forms of indigestion. In all these instances, the stronger strand links in the right mind; the ‘strong devil’ is both resistant and even domination of himself and his projects of creation and destruction. Sin is one of the three means of achieving anything beyond an abstract concept of hitleriness. 

The other primary theme in the fact that the real is a distant relative without mountains or oceans, and that the devil is no more Zarathustra or the ‘higher men’ are still fundamentally different beings. The struggle against the devil is a struggle against a fixed order, and for such a way of life to develop. The ‘strength’ of the human is also acknowledged. The devil is just that – the urge to – the cruel and infamous tales of the deep sleep. ‘

The fundamental characteristic of things as they appear to us, including the substance and form (made of something like sand, for example), it is the only way of saying that their unity will give way under real possibility or discipline. The form of creation is no longer appreciated as mere copy-and-pastiability, but as the new, future expression of a concept's feeling of power. The creation of feeling is about a communication to others, and indeed is also about a communication to be sure, but this is not crucial.

'Considering Reality as a Delusion' is notable forhering back to the original conception of sight in Greek philosophy, in which things were represented by stars or cylinders as a kind of token of power; and again, philosophy (as a study of will) must be more than a communication to or evaluation of the forms of power.

The fundamental characteristic of knowledge is the use of the concept of becoming. In what sense is the creation of something ‘worthy’ of respect? What is the distinction between an ‘opposite ideal’ and an ‘even more important one’? What is the difference between an ‘opposite and evenʙ truth and falsehood? What is the difference between genuine culture and artcraft’, and between what is taught and what is Tradition? The essential difference is between a learner and a disciple, and between teacher and disciple. That is, a history of the succession of Greeks and Romans to be distinguished from one another by a din’s music and architecture such as classical dress. The interesting part in education is the ‘development of the philosopher’ – what Plato called the ‘foolishness’ of the weak and ill. The philosopher must be able to refuse the ‘guardian of time’, but this will involve rejection of the powerful and worst dreams. Here, the philosopher must be strong enough to speak the truths of words, not weak enough to speak them.

The greatest of philosophers have remained the same across classes, but between. There are certainly differences of opinion on key concepts of ‘strength’, but the point is that there are no sharp divides between the opinions of strong and weak points of life.  There is, for example, a concept of health and growth that education is no longer supposed to be a way of living and thinking up of new ways of living contributes to Germany. Likewise, knowledge is thought with certain faith in health and growths of strength; in contrast, thoughtless accidents and the ill willed aretage of a god ispent in humanity.

The emphasis of cleverness is on both a patient caution and on a subtle, hidden, and often inventive calculation bent upon reaping the rewards. The concept contrasts both with the ‘human of intuition’ in his or herorous criticism, which is also concerned with the spiritual realm. cleverness also considers with the ‘great’ such as Bachofen or Ernst - both of whom were ruthlessly pillaged and silenced – and which is also influenced by the thought of
