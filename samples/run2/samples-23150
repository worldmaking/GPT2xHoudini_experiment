 apprehended, even the state, can look back. The concept of the ‘abyss of agon’, for example, talks about the ‘deepening’ of the dominion of the abyss over the heart of the sleeper. The abyss has nothing to do with comfort or pleasure, true religious life, or the quiet contemplation of the great lines of the Bible. The point is: how can knowledge be knowledge of the actual, but not of things like physiology, psychology, philosophy, or life or mental functions? The related notion is that the human has no intrinsic relation to the sky or the clouds; and, the sky is both the ‘beast of prey’ and the ‘last human’ within us. All this sounds very much like the philosophy of Parmenides, except that he talks about exploring the voids of other philosophies (including ours), as well as the void and gloom of dream.

Although in philosophical history the notion of dialectic has other reference points than this (Kant and Hegel, particularly), the use of the term here is exclusively about Socrates (and by extension Plato).

What one habitually eats, and drinks has a relationship to one’s spiritual life – that is, on what we think and how we value. The traditional diets of various nations, the religious practice of fasting or the role of beer in German culture are ample proof. More generally, this is part of the concern with the ‘closest things’: the spiritual significance of the patterns of life that are usually overlooked by philosophers on the hunt of ‘big’ issues. The interesting part in diet is that it has a metaphorical counterpoint in the idea of ‘incorporation’: the way the will to power absorbs, digests, makes its other powers, values, or ideas.

Digestion has several meanings. First, philosophers have always chased after the significant issues and ignored the closest things, such as the food we eat. His discussions of digestion, intestines or stomachs are thus meant to be suggestions as to how certain daily life practices affect the spiritual domain of beliefs and ideas. Second, digestion is a metaphor for the ability of an individual or group to live with specific facts or conditions, which is about those who find life indigestible and therefore want its end.

Similarly, human beings in the modern period are called homo pemphigus because they can consume everything, indiscriminately, without benefit and decision. In contrast, the ‘coming philosophers will have ‘teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible’, meaning will be able to deal with – and indeed form a new mode of life out of – dangerous truths. Excrement, the product of digestion, is a strong metaphor also. Pessimists only view the world’s ‘backside’. Writing is, therefore, a necessity, like having to relieve oneself – which is a joking elaboration of the idea that ‘my writings speak only of my overcoming’. Third, to consume or digest means to make something one’s own, and thereby have power over something.

Dionysius is a Greek deity. It is employed with many features of the myths and cultural practices associated with Dionysus, either as anthropological reference points, or as symbols: the association with grapevines, wine and intoxication; the association both with harvest and with spring, and thus both with plenty and with sexuality; the fact that the tragedy and comedy competition was held at a festival to Dionysus; that Dionysus’ mortal mother made Zeus reveal his full divinity, and was killed by Zeus’ lightning; that as a child he was hidden and protected in a cave by nymphs; that, in some tales, he is torn apart but then reborn; that Dionysus marries Ariadne, after she was abandoned by Theseus; that he is represented both as kind and generous, though also cruel to his enemies; his association with lions and dolphins, as well as minor mythic creatures such as satyrs or nymphs; the reported savagely destructive behaviour of devotees during certain religious rites; and in general the association of Dionysus with joy and with release from labour or care.

The Dionysian is one of the three cultural drives in The Birth of Tragedy, along with the Apollonian and Socratic. The Dionysian is there associated with intoxication, ecstasy (being- outside-of-oneself), and thus with cultural productions such as lyric poetry and many aspects of music (especially harmony).  This artistic drive implicitly has a metaphysics (i.e. a way of understanding the nature of reality). The coming together of Dionys

 apprehended, in order that sensuous drives or the drives of states could act as reaction pieces within a moral. The universal is that which, acting or aware, is impossible or even unlikely to be the 'opposite" of itself. Thus, the dispersion of the whole of the human type will be possible only in unity. Such unity is not possible under a system of outside influences.

Moreover, 'unity' is not the same as 'sense'. 'Distress' is also used as the concept of the despising of the master.  'Digestion' means that even the 'right' to believe is a 'pessimistic' one, one that needs rescuing from. That is, the 'right' to believe is not the same as the 'right of the least' – 'the least' will be the kind of people who are genuinely grateful for their situation. Thus, the even for 'the' is not necessarily the same as the given type. Thus, the 'right' to believe is not the same as 'wrong'. Indeed, the 'right' is not the same as the spoils. This is typical of many 'cultural revolutions' like the 'Yellow fever' or the counter-cultural 'Native Australians' is often 'disappeared' in favour of  'foreign'.

Moreover, the noble attempt to overcome cruelty was an attack on the 'sense of the' (the concept was also employed by Kant and Schopenhauer) and a new type of philosopher would be able to use the underlying concepts of science, logic and reason to understand the world. The attempt to understand also came into being after the disaster. First, that the noble is a kind of ‘concept-mistress of the will’ – the attempt was made to interfere in lives, to crush the creative spirit. Second, that ‘future generations’ will be more powerful and creative than their predecessors. Third, that the great human is a kind of ‘soul’, a type of ‘animal’. Still, the idea of becoming a philosopher is different. It is used as a reference point in fiction and as a means of illustrating the immensity of the human’s spiritual growth.

Conscience is one's sense that what one is doing is the 'right' or 'wrong' thing; the concept applies whatever the sphere of action is (intellectual, practical, moral) and whatever standard of right or wrong is relevant. For example, despite temptations, the rigorous seeker after truth cannot return to romanticism or Christianity without 'dirtying' his or her intellectual conscience. Conscience can be individual, or some group can act as the conscience of a people. For example, the great moralists were philosophers, not as a group; and, the morality of selfishness that is traced back to Aristotle is a frequent object of discussion. However, such a view is naïve concerning the broader context of culture, and thus is not presented as an issues-oriented book.

Moreover, the idea of conscience is not confined to texts; there are also other types of conscience, many of which are far more widespread and dynamic than the obvious "what are they? What are they? What are their meanings? What are their meanings? These various ways of thinking conflict with one another,ifying the good and bad conscience. The various ways of living together under the world; thus, the good conscience. Conscience in its best sense is a challenge to the good conscience. Thus, it is the challenge of a healthy and ascending life, one that is not in the pursuit of power.

The images of cat relate to the cat family from domestic cats to tigers and lions. The lion stands for exceptional strength, ravenous desire, strong will to power, but is primarily destructive and only prefiguring creation. The figure of the lion is an echo of Plato’s analogy, where the lion stands for the thump’s element of the soul and spiritedness. The lion figures prominently hint the sign that the days of loneliness are over. Also, the symbol of lions is as combining power with gentleness.

The tiger is one of the animals associated in mythology with Dionysus, which explicitly refers to fat. The tiger’s wildness is not tamed by, but directly not opposed to Dionysus’ needs or purposes. As one lush growth of the tropical south, the tiger is a symbol of wanton and sudden destructiveness (always about to leap) and over-abundance (‘Homer’s Contest’). Thus, also the tiger’s wildness is a metaphor for

Anthropomorphism means to impose the form or qualities of the human onto something. The innumerable ways in which the histories of science, philosophy or religion have involved anthropomorphism. A key example is the concept of cause and effect in nature that this separation of cause and effect is an anthropomorphism, founded upon what is already a false characterisation of human action in terms of will. The whole of our knowledge of the world (including human beings) is anthropomorphic.

On the one hand, then, these anthropomorphisms are illegitimate (they are ‘lies’), despite their enormous utility for human beings. On the other hand, there stays a danger of the destruction of culture through the overemphasis on critique (historicism, specialisation, etc.). The generation of greatness, the flourishing and advancement of the human depend upon such ‘lies’ being productive in the realm of culture.

Aphorisms is a brief, self-contained and striking piece of writing, usually gathered in sequences. Aphoristic writing was common in ancient literature and was employed by many authors. First, a random series of very brief sayings or epigrams, and second a series of longer pieces, each like a short study. There are a few added variations. Likewise, and regardless of the presence of an overarching theme to the series, aphorisms can speak to each other, as if they were short segments of a continuous piece of writing. 

The different rhythms of these various ways of writing and the different interpretative demands make on readers. The function of such writing as fully developed thoughts with either maximally compressed, or fragmentary, expression and an ‘immortal’ perfection of the form; aphorisms serve as a kind of test of readers; or an interpretative task set to readers, perhaps because the expression is deliberately incomplete.

Apollonian is named after the Greek God Apollo; this is one of three drives that it is a key to understanding cultural production and cultural change, from the ancient  Greek world on. The other two are Dionysian and Socratic. A  brief period in which the Apollonian and Dionysian work together produces ancient tragedy. The Apollonian is the origin of those cultural forms where beauty and clarity of form are emphasised (examples would be epic poetry, architecture, and sculpture), and the effects of calm or cheerfulness. Apollonian implicitly carries with it a metaphysical view concerning reality, that is, the belief that individual entities are ontologically original. Importantly, though, the Apollonian is also characterised by an awareness that these valued forms are an illusion to a Dionysian view of existence (a dream in which we are aware we are dreaming). Thus, the Apollonian should not be understood as a kind of self-deception or turning away from the real (that would be more akin to the Socratic). In his later work, the Apollonian is no longer thought of as a competing, brother drive to the Dionysian, but as a moment (of calm, stillness, beauty, image, etc.) within the latter
