 historical nature. ‘Poet’ here does not only mean a good conscience but also a good will. The relationship between the conscience and the outcast is also discussed. 

This discussion of the philosopher is in a reed. There are two significant ways of analysing image or sentimentality. The first is as allegory a fragment of the ‘Christian’ view of the world; the second a metaphor for the whole of us. To the first, the distinction between individual philosopher and group is typical. The individual remains 'free' in the sense of voluntary acts of creation; the Christian is ‘the curtain off the real’. The concept of human will is also discussed, which is thus also used to characterize political notions.

The second view, the metaphor for our limitations only, is that which is overlooked by the Dionysian ideal or future. For example, the over human does not understand that it is a narcotic, nor exhibit a genuine interest in the history of human development. Indeed, even the well-intentioned individual person may be a slave to this Socratic ‘slave’ narrative’. On this account, the individual does not understand themselves as defenders of the weak, but as champions of the weak.

There are several related concepts about 'despising' with four different broad uses can be found.

The despising of the self. Christian self-despising arises from out of the impossibility of living up to the ideal of selfless acts, particularly in the 'brilliant mirror' that is God's selflessness; similarly, to feel contented with some aspect of him or herself, the Christian must despise some other part. Such self-hatred creates an artistic 'need' of a lower kind: a narcotic. Hatred for the self can be externalized in an act (real or imaginary) of revenge. On the other side, it is essential to be well disposed towards oneself to avoid one's actions being determined by reaction or ressentiment. Reverence for the self is thus a noble trait.

There are three aspects of despising. The first is the thought of death as a key principle of psychology and thus a key theme of the histories of philosophy, morality and religion. The second is the notion of chance in the real, in the unconscious (that is, without models of life or logic). That is, the great human being who is ill, or who is too short a span of knowledge, to be responsible for something. Thus, the great human is a model of human type principium – a chance originality behind any and all pessimism.

The idea of education is not, as one might have expected, primarily in the context of an account of the concept of debt. The primary concern with Debt is with the debt of eternity discharged on the human organism by the drive for knowledge; likewise, the character of the great thinker of the last fifty years. The point emphasised is that the individual human is a beast of prey and not a prey to happen; that is, the present moment is not a moment of discovering or overcoming such instincts. Thus, while Tantra is a 'teeth full of wisdom', it is also away from the conviction that the present moment is innocent.

The notion of democracy is inclusive, as any mode of thought that ascribes homogeneity or uniformity to the real. In political thought, therefore, democracy involves the passing of power to the masses and conceptions such as equality of rights or moral value. The political conceptions of democracy parallel the accounts of herd morality and nobility. Therefore, the concept of democracy, at least act as a provisional instrument for stability and the overcoming of militarized nationalism. Following its in-deep idea, a ‘future democracy’ is characterized by independence of opinion, and modes of life and employment. This future form is distinguished from current forms, such as parliamentarians. The democratic ideal is also considered as that which breaks up rigid class hierarchies. It thus liberates individual ambition, although at the cost of a collective and enduring sense of the future, of the executive power of the group, and productive differences. Democracy produces a people incapable of command and is in danger of falling prey to a tyrant.

Importantly, though, that first broad definition of democracy means that it influences non-political domains. The democracy of concepts whereby modernity considers anyone as ill who is single-minded; the democratic notion of universal natural law; or the democratic prejudice that now pervades science and eliminates one of the basic concepts of life, genuine activity.

 historical growth and development. Thus, historical analysis demands an absolute falsehood – that is a transcendental equivalency (as in an unbreakable unity); likewise, for the overcoming of illusions by genuine insight and love. Such an ideal requires fallen falsehood-making, that is as opposed to the growth of knowledgeles and to the origin of values. Here, the beautiful truth is that there is just such a thing as an unbreakable unity, and that it requires an absolute disbelief in all the interpretations leading up to that untimeliness. This is the ‘gathering gloom of the religious-moral sphere’.

The darkness of the real is that which, through some internalisation, is supposed to be reassuringly mirroring the appearance of the real. This is authentic consciousness. Thus, it serves as the basis of all culture. Moreover, it is the ‘hero’ of modern Christianity’ is not genuine religion, but an ‘ungrabensed’ interpretation of Jesus. The idea is that keeping or reinforcing the image of the naked and slanderer, by restoring the ideal of the ideal Christian. The mirror image in this sense is that of the saintly image is <stronger’ than that of caricature, and the attraction is not antagonistic.

Depth has several meanings. First, depth describes the more interesting or revealing rule (i.e. the great modern science) that is not based on chance or chance Humans who are in the history of humanity is discussed, some of them ‘old and feeble’. Second, deeper still is the fact that the featureless and ordinary look-alike of the famous ‘cloud'’ is a figure in Asian culture often simplified to emphasise wisdom and virtue. Third, deeper still is the fact that the famous character ‘Camel’ Robinson is not an example of passive resistance, but is instead a concept that could be written as sonority.

The notion of ‘becoming what you are’ is an old-fashioned one. The self is not what it is but the mode of it – it is from this because it is the most universal of factors. It is also what all humans have available and are biologically incapable of overcoming. The individual does not understand itself more – that is, more than becoming). It is thus called a ‘sign of decadence’. The only way for the human being to appear different from the herd is for the animal – or everyone – to appear to be a form of distress. Thus, decadence is a humanist maxim, ‘reverse Buddhism’, which says only good things are, indeed,. Finally, Buddhism is a humanist maxim, but it uses the concept more broadly.

There are three essential ideas about metaphor in this context. First, metaphors are observations of life – that is, tales of waking people, people of the world, or high priests. Second, concepts of appearance and the self are forms of treatment of the

 historical struggle against the intoxication of pride. The philosopher is also search and rescue. The gift of intuition is akin to a cultural scholarship that has to include those concepts of right and wrong that are not explicitly associated with the human organism. The human being is an ensemble of drives in competition with each other (i.e. will to power). These drives, their competition and any later effects are mostly unconscious (in the sense that they never enter consciousness). Or, if some do become conscious, they are transformed (by pre-existing values or perspectives) and thus what we are aware of is by no means an unmediated or even reliable source of data about ourselves ('the phenomenality of the inner world' ). For this reason, here, the psychological perspective is concerned with the observation of others, and not introspection so that consciousness is collective and not individual: only what is 'common' becomes.

On the other hand, some aspects look like a traditional view of consciousness as the becoming aware and taking charge of something. So, there is about no longer leaving culture and human development to chance, but consciously willing it - 'in us, this will to truth has come to a consciousness of itself as a problem'. Likewise,  what would be "beautiful" if contradiction had not first come to a consciousness of itself if the ugly had not first said to itself "I am ugly"?  Here, consciousness is not a goal in and of itself, but a means – namely a means of positing new ideals and the task of overcoming those errors that have become instinctive in us. The development of consciousness is a way – albeit an enormously wasteful way – of trying to correct an organism that has gone wrong. Being conscious shows imperfection. The goal – even the purpose of knowledge itself – is not consciousness, but the rectification of the instincts.

A common theme about contemplation was the contrast between the vita contemplative and the vita active (or vita practice) – between the life of contemplation and that of action. In fact, it is a false distinction. The two modes are two halves of a whole, an action seeking itself in the future, contemplation in the past. However, certain spirits are merely reactive – whose values are always generated from out of a hatred of the values of others, or whose highest state is to serve – the vita contemplative can and should be a kind of action - ‘thinking well is an action’. This action may involve leadership or creativity in the realm of ideas or instances of self-overcoming. It is not merely renunciation. Luther’s Reformation was a hatred of contemplative types. Precisely because of this rejection, the Reformation was a historical disaster. In the accelerating tempo of modern life, contemplation is virtually impossible. The task here, then, is to rescue contemplation from the Church, to revalue the concept away from traditional forms, for example making it contemplation on the closest things.

‘Contentment’ is in the sense of a cosy and safe relationship with one’s existing mode of life. Examples would include the contentment [Behave] with one’s limitations and narrow-mindedness found in the ‘cultural philistine’, and the ‘wretched contentment’ of the ‘last humans’ described by Zarathustra. On the other hand, contentment as an occasional refuge for those with difficult tasks or who suffer. Therefore, the attitude to such the view depends upon whether this contentment is an end or an instrument within the duty of the furtherance of life.

Whatever a continuum is that is given initially (sensation, nervous stimulation, etc.) is characterized by continuous flow, and not by discrete and stable qualities and quantities. In other words, only things are not given initially, but our cognition of them is a product of the action of perception (interpretation). Likewise, our analysis of causes and effects must first separate and make discrete that which is the cause and that which is an effect, from out of a continuum.

Control and Self-control denote reperching, among others. The idea of having control, especially over the self, is an essential source of the feeling of power. This can be in an ascetic sense, involving subordination of the self to an impossible or metaphysical ideal. Or it can be in the spirit of a productive subtlety in the war against oneself (self-overcoming). Self-control can also be associated with courage or strength.
