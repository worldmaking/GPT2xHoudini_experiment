 of life). This is a discussion of issues such as the ‘reflection of haunted lands’; likewise, for an analysis of the negative as ‘dirty’.

The images of cat relate to the cat family from domestic cats to tigers and lions. The lion stands for exceptional strength, ravenous desire, strong will to power, but is primarily destructive and only prefiguring creation. The figure of the lion is an echo of Plato’s analogy, where the lion stands for the thump’s element of the soul and spiritedness. The lion figures prominently hint the sign that the days of loneliness are over. Also, the symbol of lions is as combining power with gentleness.

The tiger is one of the animals associated in mythology with Dionysus, which explicitly refers to fat. The tiger’s wildness is not tamed by, but directly not opposed to Dionysus’ needs or purposes. As one lush growth of the tropical south, the tiger is a symbol of wanton and sudden destructiveness (always about to leap) and over-abundance (‘Homer’s Contest’). Thus, also the tiger is the figure of that sudden urge to traitorous injustice among the Greeks, which requires the state to keep it in check. This tension can be seen negatively as unresolved, lacking perfection or direction. The ‘higher men’ are compared to a tiger that has failed in its leap – that is, ashamed of their action, and not accepting the role of chance in the growth of the human.

In general, the cat is an incompletely domesticated animal that it appears peaceful, loves comfort, but has a residual wildness, remains akin to a beast of prey and is mischievous or wilful. Also, the clouds are implied to cats, incapable of decision; and, cats are also compared with the figure of a woman. However, the cat is incapable of giving, reciprocity or love. In this, it is the opposite of the dog—moreover, the images of granite statues of cats, standing for old-fashioned values, heavy and unmovable.

The notion of ‘category’ has a long history of philosophy, beginning with Aristotle. In Kant, the categories form a set of 12 essential and a priori concepts under which all experience falls. They thus describe the structure of experience and its limits but also supply a transcendental account of how knowledge is possible in the first place.

Causality is one of the critical physical and metaphysical lines of thought. There are several aspects. Although using some of the same concepts as ‘On Truth and Lies’useful as a kind of shorthand for describing and predicting, the concepts of cause and effect require us to posit the cause and the effect as separable and identifiable; that is, each must be a stable entity. In truth, a continuum faces us, and every causal event is an infinite number of processes. Cause and effect thus offer no real understanding or explanation. This simplifying treatment of cause and effect is founded upon a natural, but mistaken, analysis of will – our clear willing and effecting becomes a model for natural processes. Cause and effect do not follow ‘laws. This notion of natural law as something that ‘governs’ also is an illegitimate application of our (mistaken) notion of willing according to a maxim. The critique of causality also amounts to an evaluation of mechanical thought (all nature consists of pushing and pulling entities). Natural causality is replaced by the concept of a network of forces – that is with the will to power. Among other things, this new concept demands (as against mechanism) ‘action at a distance’. Importantly,  this concept of cause and effect includes a diagnosis of the psychological needs that might explain its adoption.

Second, there are some natural processes at work that are gestured towards by the concept of cause and effect. This whole natural realm contrasts with an unnatural or anti-natural sense of cause and effect: the idea of a sin against God, ‘spiritual causality’, or the cause of itself that is both an account of God but also a model of free will. In all these cases, a cause is posited that lies outside the natural sequence. There is also a necessary amount of foolishness involved in interpreting such conception as necessary or harmless. In truth, a clear and present danger is precisely in

 of what is valued (and not what you are), and by what you are good at. This bad writing has an effect on all values, though mainly in a positive and energetic sense. This bad conscience is mostly left unresolved, requiring a creative, new and more productive way of life.

In his later work, the ‘critic is a false distinction between opinion and practice', and in his later work, the ‘critic is a toolbox for practical perspectives’. Still, these tools are often empty – and thus often not productive – ways of giving contentment. The relationship between opinion and practice is also not appreciated. On both these grounds, the first two are directed towards the philosophical tradition – a very philosophical tradition, but more specifically a misplaced and narrow conception of the power of will to power. Moreover, the notion of freedom is again not appreciated. For, in fact, tyranny is something that can only be overcome by a conscious or willing effort from the ego; by which is also meant a conscious deliberation about, and choice not to transform, this. Thus, the crucial 'upheel' moment in Marx's where he says to himself ‘I am a realist, a realist, a real person’. All these words may be understood as saying that all opinions are ‘beliefs’, and all beliefs, opinions or values formed of conflict, angry emotion, misunderstanding or even murder. All these words also mean that they focus on the issue of the basis of the rejection or questioning of values. That is, if there is any kind of a priori or even pre- creatial need in the human, then having a ‘critique of the human-animal’ is needed for such creation to cease. 

The second aspect of atheism is that no causal process or overall state of being can be responsible for the occurrence of suffering or great need. This is asceticism without causes. The cause of this ‘accumulated will’, then, is either revelation (that is the principle by which knowledge is understood) or utility (that is the ability to fight an actual or actual cause and effect). Socratic thought is the overcoming of the impurity of soul and ruined future. The dream is also the moment of perfection and the moment of creation (i.e. of the ‘perfect world’).

Abandoning a belief in a transcendent God is a step forward culturally. However, in general, the issue of a god’s existence is far from the most critical aspect. More important are questions like the following: (i) what does the need to posit a god’s existence say about the believer?  (ii) What does atheistic questioning say about the metaphysical commitments of the questioner? So, for example, atheism ‘today’ stays in the tradition of the ascetic ideal. Likewise, the hidden implication of theism with science, language or morality means that unbelief is often blind to its causes and consequences. (iii) What ideals are posited in a belief? To be sure, atheism has a long way to offer both to the highest human form and to a future of new possibilities for human life and growth. Still, it is a necessary evil, the consequence of failed projects, behind the mask of altruism. Likewise, atheism ‘bent on eternal recurrence’ and the gods, or those individuals or peoples who were genuinely great, but were also Motiveless and without having a will.

Abandoning a belief in a transcendent God is a step forward culturally. However, this will require that all belief systems or ideas are anthropomorphic. A few cases of definingorthpace, where the focus is on the diversity of perspectives within a movement, is an attempt to brand them with a long-imposed limit, which is to claim that the movement culture has of monopoly. Also, the use of the term 'decadence' within the social sphere is in the context of a discussion of the decline of decadence. There is a distinguish between an authentic and an inauthentic spirit of atheism in the form of Derrida. Authentic themselves are an oversaturated (i.e. the focus of popular culture and intellectual development). They are a necessary part of all human existence. Savage as such, atheism is found in both an oversaturated and an inauthentic ideal. The vital idea from Epicurus,  namely,  that humans of the original ‘great’ are incapable of embracing life, that makes living contemplation too difficult, and therefore lead to the abandonment of human life find in Epicurus the Epic of Silenus a valuable test of virtue.

Contempt act as a feeling of power. To have contempt for something – that is, for one’s negative value judgement to achieve the level of a passion – is a mode of feeling power-over. It is, therefore, a primary drive. Likewise, the modern feeling that freedom is an absence of discipline. Equally importantly, the sense of power is a vital part of pity. Alternatively, self-contempt is found in empathy, as far as one projects one’s suffering onto others.

The devil has three primary meanings. First, it is common fears and traditional conceptions of evil. Second, the devil may be certain temptations, through which one might deviate from or be held down from one’s path of growth. Zarathustra’s devil is the ‘spirit of gravity’, while the sorcerers is ‘spirit of melancholy’ (gravity and melancholy are both variations on the word ‘Schwarz’ which means ‘heavy’). Third, the devil indicates the interconnection of the good and the bad, the positive and negative (i.e. the notion that opposites are not opposite). Thus, the devil is just God’s leisure every seventh day.

Although in philosophical history the notion of dialectic has other reference points than this (Kant and Hegel, particularly), the use of the term here is exclusively about Socrates (and by extension Plato).

What one habitually eats, and drinks has a relationship to one’s spiritual life – that is, on what we think and how we value. The traditional diets of various nations, the religious practice of fasting or the role of beer in German culture are ample proof. More generally, this is part of the concern with the ‘closest things’: the spiritual significance of the patterns of life that are usually overlooked by philosophers on the hunt of ‘big’ issues. The interesting part in diet is that it has a metaphorical counterpoint in the idea of ‘incorporation’: the way the will to power absorbs, digests, makes its other powers, values, or ideas.

Digestion has several meanings. First, philosophers have always chased after the significant issues and ignored the closest things, such as the food we eat. His discussions of digestion, intestines or stomachs are thus meant to be suggestions as to how certain daily life practices affect the spiritual domain of beliefs and ideas. Second, digestion is a metaphor for the ability of an individual or group to live with specific facts or conditions, which is about those who find life indigestible and therefore want its end.

Similarly, human beings in the modern period are called homo pemphigus because they can consume everything, indiscriminately, without benefit and decision. In contrast, the ‘coming philosophers will have ‘teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible’, meaning will be able to deal with – and indeed form a new mode of life out of – dangerous truths. Excrement, the product of digestion, is a strong metaphor also. Pessimists only view the world’s ‘backside’. Writing is, therefore, a necessity, like having to relieve oneself – which is a joking elaboration of the idea that ‘my writings speak only of my overcoming’. Third, to consume or digest means to make something one’s own, and thereby have power over something.

Dionysius is a Greek deity. It is employed with many features of the myths and cultural practices associated with Dionysus, either as anthropological reference points, or as symbols: the association with grapevines, wine and intoxication; the association both with harvest and with spring, and thus both with plenty and with sexuality; the fact that the tragedy and comedy competition was held at a festival to Dionysus; that Dionysus’ mortal mother made Zeus reveal his full divinity, and was killed by Zeus’ lightning; that as a child he was hidden and protected in a cave by nymphs; that, in some tales, he is torn apart but then reborn; that Dionysus marries Ariadne, after she was abandoned by Theseus; that he is represented both as kind and generous, though also cruel to his enemies; his association with lions and dolphins, as well as minor mythic creatures such as satyrs or nymphs; the reported savagely destructive behaviour of devotees during certain religious rites; and in general the association of Dionysus with joy and with release from labour or care.

The Dionysian is one of the three cultural drives
