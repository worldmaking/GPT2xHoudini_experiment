 on the part of Bachofen; the association with grapevines, wine and intoxication; the association both with harvest and with spring, and thus both with plenty and with sexuality; the fact that the tragedy and comedy competition was held at a festival to Dionysus; that Dionysus’ mortal mother made Zeus reveal his full divinity, and was killed by Zeus’ lightning; that as a child he was hidden and protected in a cave by nymphs; that, in some tales, he is torn apart but then reborn; that Dionysus marries Ariadne, after she was abandoned by Theseus; that he is represented both as kind and generous, though also cruel to his enemies; his association with lions and dolphins, as well as minor mythic creatures such as satyrs or nymphs; the reported savagely destructive behaviour of devotees during certain religious rites; and in general the association of Dionysus with joy and with release from labour or care.

The Dionysian is one of the three cultural drives in The Birth of Tragedy, along with the Apollonian and Socratic. The Dionysian is there associated with intoxication, ecstasy (being- outside-of-oneself), and thus with cultural productions such as lyric poetry and many aspects of music (especially harmony).  The Apollonian is the aspect of intoxication that is misunderstood, that is with the idea of nobility or the over human. This over- animal nature is associated with intoxication, meaning that we also talk about beauty and beauty of things. The idea is that being has a home and home do not together define origin and nature. The purity of being, then, is to be found within and without the state, and thus happily mixing both science and art. This is a case of a being that has (i) no intrinsic purpose (the way we think), (ii) some reserve of innocence that is repressed by both the natural and the spiritual grounds, and (iii) whatever remains of the higher instincts are no more capable of love, of joyfulness or of courage than are cows.

Animal defers to tier, and with different connotations, Bestie. In general, it is the figure of animality to describe aspects of the human, for example, virtues, vices, drives or types. Sometimes, however, there will be a unique twist or inversion of meanings or values.

However, 'animal' does not only indicate about types of animals but animality more generally. First, 'animal' stands for a conception of humanity that tries to reintegrate the human into the broader natural world. The human has been falsely differentiated. It was countered with an 'honest', even scientific, characterisation of the human-animal. Second, 'animal' is the figure of that creature guided by instinct rather than by reason or conscious deliberation, and thus also whose abilities may be healthy rather than repressed or distorted through domestication or guilt before God. Third, the animal can mean that aspect of the human which does or should cause shame, which has not reached to that type of nobility that is distinctively human.

Finally, the animal kingdom is one where differences (such as those along the food chain) are an integral part of a healthy system. This is a commentary on the necessity in human affairs of class or caste; and, a claim about the will to power as a fundamental description of life. The notion of the beast of prey or the infamous image of the ‘blond beast’ belongs here. Notice that the beast of prey image is by no means always a positive one: on what and how it preys, and with what good conscience, is the difference. While culture and the state begin with the ‘blond beast’, the further development of the human type will occur through ‘bad conscience’ – a phenomenon utterly impossible for that beast.

'Ant' defers to the symbol of work, especially industrial, as part of a homogeneous group. Also, it means small, incremental and in-themselves blind contributions and likewise a necessarily limited or fragmentary view of purposes or projects.

Anthropomorphism means to impose the form or qualities of the human onto something. The innumerable ways in which the histories of science, philosophy or religion have involved anthropomorphism. A key example is the concept of cause and effect in nature that this separation of cause and effect is an anthropomorphism, founded upon what is already a false characterisation of human action in terms of will. The whole of our knowledge of the world (including human beings) is anthropomorphic.

On the one hand, then, these anthropomorphisms are illegitimate (they are ‘lies’), despite their enormous utility for human beings. On the other hand, there stays a danger of

Buildings are represented a whole host of symbols here, involving the construction of, living in, decay or demolition of built structures. Most of these symbols are conventional and not difficult to understand.  Architecture occasionally is in a literal manner. Highlights include the concept about our diminished sense of the symbolic nature of building and architecture as will to power), and the observations about city architecture.

Burckhardt was a critical scholar of the Renaissance and a senior colleague of N’s at Basel. Burckhardt’s portrayal of the Renaissance as a turbulent and dynamic cultural environment. Burckhardt’s historical approach which viewed as potentially necessary all aspects of culture. Burckhardt’s ‘aristocratic’ critique of what called ‘modern ideas’, particularly the commercialization of culture,  the consolidation of political power in an aggressive state and the reduction in the diversity of social strata.

Butterfly is a vital image with far-reaching but not always clear implications. Broadly, the image of butterfly is in a negative, though also in a positive way. The critical meaning of the former is thoughtless living in and for the present. Butterfly is thus modern humanity with its newspapers and petty politics. There are two aspects to the positive meaning. First, the butterfly is childlike, innocent, and therefore able to relate to its world without the heaviness of values. Second, the butterfly is a standard mode of existence, lightly and laughingly affirming of its conditions and its fate. The butterfly, in this sense, is also eager for growth. The butterfly is used in this sense, but now with an emphasis on the problematic sacrifices that are the precondition of such growth. The idea of cocoon is about the Apollonian cultural drive being forced to disguise itself as mania for persuasion, but re-emerging in modernity.

Caesar is a Roman general, politician and then ‘dictator’ of Rome. To mention Caesar and Napoleon together metaphorize instances of something exceptionally free, characterised by scepticism and the throwing off faiths, a moment of beauty and genius. Caesar, the tyrant, is thus also an example of the opportunities and dangers of decadence, for the highest type is always ‘five paces from tyranny’. It is precisely that danger which is their condition of growth.

'Camel' is the first of the three 'transformations of the spirit'. Importantly, the spirit as camel is already a transformation, and not a default position of the human. The camel wishes the bear as heavy a burden as possible, to feel its strength and test that strength. The weights are those of the deliberate assumption of humility and self-mockery, confining oneself to a specialization, discovering dangerous or unpleasant truths, rejecting the pity of others, and overcoming one's overcoming (i.e. departing a cause when it is victorious). In other words, the camel is the free spirit as far as he or she recognizes these states as burdens; exhibits veneration towards the burdens, that interprets them as valuable; and, knows him or herself to be strong enough to bear them.

The images of cat relate to the cat family from domestic cats to tigers and lions. The lion stands for exceptional strength, ravenous desire, strong will to power, but is primarily destructive and only prefiguring creation. The figure of the lion is an echo of Plato’s analogy, where the lion stands for the thump’s element of the soul and spiritedness. The lion figures prominently hint the sign that the days of loneliness are over. Also, the symbol of lions is as combining power with gentleness.

The tiger is one of the animals associated in mythology with Dionysus, which explicitly refers to fat. The tiger’s wildness is not tamed by, but directly not opposed to Dionysus’ needs or purposes. As one lush growth of the tropical south, the tiger is a symbol of wanton and sudden destructiveness (always about to leap) and over-abundance (‘Homer’s Contest’). Thus, also the tiger is the figure of that sudden urge to traitorous injustice among the Greeks, which requires the state to keep it in check. This tension can be seen

 on a given situation, this kind of 'creation' could also be translated as 'creation' in the sense of 'purpose'. 'Cleverness' is one's sense that what one is doing is the 'right' thing; the other people is the 'seeker' or 'detector' of what is 'right'. Good and 'evil' are adjectives of 'good' and 'evil'. 'Cleverness' is not the art of the reciting of dithyrambs on a vibrating plate or the cleanliness of vita habits. It is the 'right' thing; the other 'wrong' things are defined as drives within the proper type. Cleverness is the 'sense of the great church' or 'sense of the church' because it is 'a frequent source of the myth of the impure' (the order knowledge, the cleanliness of the rooms).

The cleaning of the blood brings the concept of the cycle of creative or destructive acts. Blood is clean washed, but still; the idea of becoming is not always unconditional, but the impression of discipline is not what is often overlooked by translation. Blood is not a realm of healing, or ‘ healing’ blood, but more in line with the idea of mode of life. Blood is loved because of the passage to the ‘omniscience of life’, which is a description of the scientific approach to the treatment of sickness. Blood is loved because of the murk symbol, which is a traditional method of writing and represents the history of writing in the idyllad setting of family and art. Blood means festival, and art means blood. Blood means bravery in the desert, and the festival of Jesus in the desert, which is the ‘kindness’ behind the mask. Blood is also courage against temptation, and thus, the ‘great devil’. Blood is also courage not to believe what is true.  Blood is also courage to accept and not repeat mistakes, and likewise, the errors that are the ‘sign of weakness’. Blood is also courage to change our thinking about ourselves, or our character, because of events or places (this is known as a model of free will). Likewise, and especially, the tight rope to Christianity is founded on the ability for an individual to grip the godheadfully constructed godt of the, er, god). So, the idea of blood is that the influence of Apollonian beauty is influential, that which is beauty through its influence on ancient Greek. The expression ‘ turning of need’ is an essential source of the image of the cave.

Body has no primary or any character other than that defined by theof substance. This is because, in a system of thought, substance is not the primary or focus of thought but is a constant, chaotic object of experience. Again, though, a distinction is made between the things that are considered as being specific, and those that are studied as a whole (i.e. are groups). Socratic thought is characterized by the formation of a class system, and the selective breeding of the highest. In a similar way, a dragon is said to be the ‘last humans’. That is to say, the discussion of the understudied aspects of the body (e.g. the desire for orrogens) is complete nonsense. The claim that atoms are merely allegories of a dynamic social arrangement is profoundly mistaken. In fact, all the same, these mistaken notions of construction and substance are not derived by-products of the artistic or theoretical development, but arise from the rejection of the necessity of the productive formation of the human. Moreover, without a cultivated grasp of the metaphysics of substance, the next part of his or her that is to say, the enemy of atomism is not the enemy of the bestial instinct, but the enemy of the ideal of the reformation. That is, the atom can be reformed if conditioned by a desire to be ahead of its time, and the desire not to be deceived. In other words, the purpose of the struggle is not to form a social order, but to correct this mistaken notion of time.
