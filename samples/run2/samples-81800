 humans, the idea of religion is significant, as far as relates to the growth of human life and the human, is in many ways an image of the single greatest human being. This is extended even beyond the class, as the reasoning and living standards of the peoples and institutions that form a mode of life.

The such things as the ‘blond beast’ and the ‘great human’ will be judged by the resulting ‘adaptation’. The ability to create, and yet not to create have consequences. For example, the ability to create from out of factors that change over time, which is the chance of an individual becoming what they are. In other words, there is a chance of an individual becoming who little or nothingness. Also, knowledge itself is not something that is given initially, but stays where it is ‘made’. Thus, for example, the ‘fine arts’ are meant to be tools for the advantage of the higher nobility. In other words, the discussion of ideas like nobility or guilt is irrelevant. Likewise, there is a difference between an individual and an idea is supposed to be us, our contemporaries, the good and the bad, and other things based. This individual view of ourselves as the cause of others becoming aware, and thus, is what is signified in the concepts of guilt and release.

‘The Birth of Tragedy’, with its lack of scholarly apparatus, energetic and figure-laden prose, philosophical and psychological speculation, and a mixture of ancient and modern contexts, was not what the philological community expected. It has three primary purposes and correspondingly divides into three sections. First, to elaborate a theory of ancient Greek tragedy as a synthesis of two metaphysically understood cultural drives (Apollonian and Dionysian). In this way, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ solves the relationship between cheerfulness and pessimism ingeniously - how could the Greeks, with their in-depth knowledge of suffering and futility, have remained cheerful? Second, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ traces the reasons for the decline of tragedy to a third drive, the Socratic, which is also the advent of science and modernity. Third, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ seeks to understand what it would mean, and what it would take, for tragedy to be reborn in the present. The account of culture is thus revealed to be a general one, and not specific to Greece. The book is heavily influenced (although not entirely uncritically) by Schopenhauer, and especially in its third part plays homage to Wagner.

Otto von Bismarck was the leading political figure in Germany from the 1860s to 1890. Bismarck provoked wars that in turn led to the unification of Germany around Prussian leadership. His brand of pragmatic and power politics, and his nationalism, made him as a symbol of all that was wrong with modern Germany.

Blood is a metaphor of life and a key symbol in Christianity for a life made eternal by being cleansed of sin. Notably, blood stands for the specific mode of life of an individual or group; thus, history transformed into blood: morals part of our ‘flesh and blood’. Blood is accumulated and passed down, forming peoples, types, or families (Geblüt means belonging to an aristocratic family line). Blood is that which makes one strong and capable of creating so that we have the vampire or leech images; also, the life-draining of specific ideas or practices, revenge, or asceticism or nihilism. Blood is precious; therefore, the mention thereof aphorisms and of things written in blood being an effort to read. Blood is also courage and the love of danger so that which is written in blood will take risks and those who read it to take risks with themselves.  Blood means sacrifice or martyrdom, which the idea is related to Christian symbolism, but also to Bismarck’s famous speech in 1862, where he uses the phrase ‘iron and blood’ to describe a nationalistic foreign policy not afraid to risk warfare.

Body means the human body as opposed to just any material object. If one rejects dualism – an account of the mind or soul as fundamentally different from, even separable from, the body – then bodily states are sensations, appetites, passions and so on, and thought and reason. In turn, this means that the notion of body – that is, the human body as a whole – is the basis of a metaphysical system from out of affirmation, as the only basis of the ways of life that are distinct from the body. In that sense,

 humans' does not follow conventionally through history. Nevertheless, the concept of convention is anthropomorphism, and the concepts so far as they are not fundamentally different from each other but are instead underpinning the architecture of cultures. One reason for this is that culture is a projection of human values onto its objects, and thus also onto its surfaces. Thus, for example, art is a test of the ability of an individual to be useful to a social group.

'Antichrist, The' should be understood more as ‘Anti-Christian’ and tightly focused on the psychological and physiological meanings of the advent, growth, and triumph of Christianity, in comparison, especially with Buddhism. Notable for a sustained, speculative, and positive psychological interpretation of  Jesus,  as akin to a  Buddhist.  It revolves around the contrast between this Jesus and the Christ figure disastrously generated by the Church Fathers, especially Paul.

Ape primate as akin to the animal aspect of humans’ pre-dates Darwin; with Darwin thought arises the notion of a common evolutionary ancestor. The ape, then, is either an origin or disfigured mirror-image, of which we are ashamed. The ape is an imitator, unaware even of being an imitator, and which brings disrepute to the imitated.

Aphorisms is a brief, self-contained and striking piece of writing, usually gathered in sequences. Aphoristic writing was common in ancient literature and was employed by many authors. First, a random series of very brief sayings or epigrams, and second a series of longer pieces, each like a short study. There are a few added variations. Likewise, and regardless of the presence of an overarching theme to the series, aphorisms can speak to each other, as if they were short segments of a continuous piece of writing. 

The different rhythms of these various ways of writing and the different interpretative demands make on readers. The function of such writing as fully developed thoughts with either maximally compressed, or fragmentary, expression and an ‘immortal’ perfection of the form; aphorisms serve as a kind of test of readers; or an interpretative task set to readers, perhaps because the expression is deliberately incomplete.

Apollonian is named after the Greek God Apollo; this is one of three drives that it is a key to understanding cultural production and cultural change, from the ancient  Greek world on. The other two are Dionysian and Socratic. A  brief period in which the Apollonian and Dionysian work together produces ancient tragedy. The Apollonian is the origin of those cultural forms where beauty and clarity of form are emphasised (examples would be epic poetry, architecture, and sculpture), and the effects of calm or cheerfulness. Apollonian implicitly carries with it a metaphysical view concerning reality, that is, the belief that individual entities are ontologically original. Importantly, though, the Apollonian is also characterised by an awareness that these valued forms are an illusion to a Dionysian view of existence (a dream in which we are aware we are dreaming). Thus, the Apollonian should not be understood as a kind of self-deception or turning away from the real (that would be more akin to the Socratic). In his later work, the Apollonian is no longer thought of as a competing, brother drive to the Dionysian, but as a moment (of calm, stillness, beauty, image, etc.) within the latter. This is implicitly acknowledged that the ‘complete and authentic antagonism’ is between Homer and Plato: the former the deifier of life, the latter its ‘slanderer’.

The fundamental characteristic of things as they appear to us, including ourselves and bodies, is their givenness as individual form. This is Schopenhauer’s principium individuationis and the veil of Maya. Schopenhauer, in turn, was trying to interpret Kant’s distinction between appearances and things-in-themselves and incorporate ideas from Eastern thought. ‘Behind’ appearances are the will, continually striving and becoming, without form. Here, an important distinction arises between two senses of appearance: appearance as a symbolic image in genuine art, versus appearance as mere copy, and thus as possibly deceptive. Socratic thought is the forgetting of the first possibility of occurrence,  and therefore also as the advent of a modern faith in science. This theme continues throughout

 humans; second, cheerfulness as a disguise, a way of appearing to be different from, and be misunderstood by, others. Third, and most importantly, cheerfulness is part of the ideal of a new form of life that does not suffer from the defining features of modernity. This last idea is, in part, an updating of the Apollonian concept; in part, it is a new analysis of the perils of an over-historicized culture (see historical sense). Cheerfulness is thought of as an effect of the exercise of power, or of one who shows an excess of strength. Likewise, it is a characteristic of someone who has found their proper element, the role most aligned to their character. Thus, the highest human beings of the present will be both ‘cheerful’ and ‘live dangerously’. Taking the questioning of morality seriously has, as a kind of reward, cheerfulness – or the ‘gay science’. In other words, there is a stage of nausea or nihilism in the confrontation with the genealogy of values, but this stage overcomes itself in cheerfulness.

There are several related concepts about 'despising' with four different broad uses can be found.

The despising of the self. Christian self-despising arises from out of the impossibility of living up to the ideal of selfless acts, especially in the 'brilliant mirror' that is God's selflessness; similarly, to feel contented with some aspect of him or herself, the Christian must despise some other part. Such self-hatred creates an artistic 'need' of a lower kind: a narcotic to disguise one's discontentment. Hatred for the self can be externalized in an act (real or imaginary) of revenge. On the other side, it is essential to be well disposed towards oneself to avoid one's actions being determined by reaction or ressentiment. Reverence for the self is thus a noble trait.

The despising of the master. In a psychological inversion, which is also called ‘ressentiment’, those individuals or peoples who were enslaved (literally or metaphorically) created a value system from out of their hatred of their masters. Whatever characteristics the masters had, these would now be called ‘evil’; the features of the slaves (meekness, poverty, etc.) would be called ‘good’. Thus, the inversion of the ancient view that work is contemptible. Significantly, there has a clear distinction between the ‘hatred’ of the slaves and the ‘despising’ of the noble class. At the root of the latter is the ‘feeling of happiness in oneself’. 

The ‘great despising’. The idea is that the human being, as far as of fixed character and resistant to becoming and growth, must be judged despicable from the perspective of life, or of future human possibilities. The ‘great despising’ then is this judgement conceived of as generally applicable (i.e. to humanity as a whole), as a primary effect associated with our individual philosophical development, and as productive to the future of the human. An important passage is ‘On the despisers of the body’. The argument is that these despisers’ despising is worthy of respect. However, they are still in some way reactive, or incapable of ‘creating beyond themselves’; their despising is a negation and thus not productive. It is not a ‘loving despising’. Similarly, Zarathustra says to the ‘ape’ who warns him about the great city ‘I despise your despising’ for it is founded upon impotent rage and revenge. An earlier version of this idea is intriguingly entitled ‘The over animal’. Also, the theme of despising again should be understood as a revaluation of the Christian theme of loving one’s enemies - the redeeming human of the great love and despising.

Contempt act as a feeling of power. To have contempt for something – that is, for one’s negative value judgement to achieve the level of a passion – is a mode of feeling power-over. It is, therefore, a primary drive. Likewise, the modern feeling that freedom is an absence of discipline. Equally importantly, the sense of power is a vital part of pity. Alternatively, self-contempt is found in empathy, as far as one projects one’s suffering onto others.

The devil has three primary meanings. First, it is common fears and traditional conceptions of evil. Second, the devil may be certain temptations, through which one might deviate from or be held down from one’s path of growth. Zarathust
