 way to have a sense of power and the desire to avoid power differences, and to have the strength to inhibit one’s passions. Specific moral affects in terms of will to power are well advanced. Benevolence is traced back to the enhancement of power. After this point, benevolence drops out of view, to be replaced by other notions of virtue, notably veneration and magnanimity.

'Beyond Good and Evil' is notable for a more explicit discussion than is found outside his notebooks of the metaphysics that underlies N's reflections on morality and religion (e.g. the concept of the will to power). There are also nicely focused chapters on faith and virtue. The book ends with an essential evocation of the figure of Dionysus.

The Old Testament is one of the greatest, certainly the most sublime, pieces of literature, and the record of a great people. The New Testament a distasteful account of a catastrophic turn in European history. Luther's translation of the Bible into German is one of the critical events of the reformation and had a substantial formative effect upon the history of German. 'Beyond Good and Evil' is full of references to biblical events and persons, either for direct discussion or metaphorically (i.e. the images of love, gift and sacrifice are allusions to the life of Christ).

The bird is a symbol of rapid ascent, of something that needs and desires to be ahead of its time, to show spiritual growth. Birds must also be light, able to throw off burdens. The bird is thus in opposition to the spirit of heaviness. The flock of doves is precisely chosen because it is a conventional symbol of gentleness and peace but combined with the bird’s lightness and need for the ascent, and this is unlike a herd of sheep or cows, say. The dove image also has significant biblical echoes. 

The eagle (Adler) is the most common bird mentioned in N. The most famous use of the eagle is the symbol of a healthy and honest pride. The eagle can view things as beneath it; this is both a specific comprehensive sight which is not an abstraction and honest pride. The snake is cleverness. The combination of these animals (the eagle carrying the snake) is something rare: those who have pride do not understand themselves; those who are clever tend to be self-loathing. It seems likely that they also represent two significant mythic and cultural inputs into Europe, the eagle as the masculine Greek, the serpent as the feminine Judaic; their union is an expression of an as yet unrealised ‘wholeness’ of the human. The eagle is a bird of prey. Birds and especially the eagle, thus also stand for a kind of strength. Its happiness lies in relishing the terror of the great heights and the abyss, rather than in ignorance of that terror. Moreover, the eagle’s hunt is direct, straight down; it is thus, considered on its own, a noble ‘stupidity’. It is nourished on innocence, it both loves and hates the lamb – thus mirroring the relationship to the human, which is loved because of its yet unspoiled possibilities.

‘The Birth of Tragedy’, with its lack of scholarly apparatus, energetic and figure-laden prose, philosophical and psychological speculation, and a mixture of ancient and modern contexts, was not what the philological community expected. It has three primary purposes and correspondingly divides into three sections. First, to elaborate a theory of ancient Greek tragedy as a synthesis of two metaphysically understood cultural drives (Apollonian and Dionysian). In this way, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ solves the relationship between cheerfulness and pessimism ingeniously - how could the Greeks, with their in-depth knowledge of suffering and futility, have remained cheerful? Second, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ traces the reasons for the decline of tragedy to a third drive, the Socratic, which is also the advent of science and modernity. Third, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ seeks to understand what it would mean, and what it would take, for tragedy to be reborn in the present. The account of culture is thus revealed to be a general one, and not specific to Greece. The book is heavily influenced (although not entirely uncritically) by Schopenhauer, and especially in its third part plays homage to Wagner.

 way of thinking and acting is an extension of the original ideas of Apollonian beauty and tragedy as mechanisms by which growth and power are felt as the only constant.

Aristotle accounts the relation of tragedy to the eagle. The eagle is a typical eagle of the eagle family; it is the most agile and fearful of all the lions; it is the one who initially warns Alexander of the great city of Naxos, then is overcome and falls to his destructive rage. The eagle’s hunt is direct, straight down; it is the priestly type; it is thus often not afraid of the earth. Also, the eagle is the last hold-out of a metaphysical belief in myth. The eagle is the least developed of the three, particularly the eagle after Ophir is forced to give in to a desire for the feminine. The eagle is a bird of prey and is rejected by some (e.g. the lion); it is a metaphoraddin (i.e. those who are not among the great and noble), because they are not capable of dancing’. Instead, they are incapable of seeing the abyss and need ‘stupidity’. Therefore, it is Zarathustra’s eagle that tells the Spirit of Gravity to get off his back.

The root of eagle is meaning to explore. The eagle is a standard bird of prey, although it can also be a dangerous animal (‘phantom’ eagle, for example). The eagle is thus also meant to beタイギャー (eagle-eagle). The dog is something that is supposed to be wretched so that its owner can feel important or influential. The eagle is a bird of prey that has few features and is also light, ravenous, and thus not productive towards the development of the body. Second, eagle is a conventional bird of prey, but it also has a long association with power and with the idea of absolute over human. Third, eagle is the ability to appear as the masculine and feminine, and also as fat and weak. Fourth, the eagle is the most beautiful animal on the earth, and second only to the tiger-frog Plaschenko. Fifth, the eagle is the most anthropomorphised – the symbol of animal, particularly eagle, characterises European thought from the mid-nineteenth century on. Sixth, the eagle is the most anthropomorphic – that is, the anthropomorphism in the display of anthropomorphism (e.g. the eagle leaps and falls, trying to leap) but also in an attempt to make sense of differences. A key example of this is the commonly used notion of disinterest.

Agon means 'contest', 'competition', 'strife' or 'struggle'. Agon is the concept under the headings of words such as 'Streit' (fight or battle), 'Kampf' (contest or struggle). First, Heraclitus as positing 'strife' as the basic principle behind the popular notion of continual flux. Second, Greek cultural life was to the extent that competitors who were too powerful were ostracised. Third, the real Zarathustra, the ancient Persian religious figure, conceived of the cosmos as a battle between good and evil forces. Fourth, there are later philosophers or scientists who, in one way or another, posit conflict at the root of human or animal action. These would include  Hobbes  (who conceived of human nature as fundamentally incapable of peace,  and state power as the mechanism for controlling this nature), Schopenhauer and Darwin (the struggle for existence is an essential condition for natural selection). There is a fundamental difference among these influences: on the Greek conception (and arguably also in Darwin), strife and contest are positive, generating in Heraclitus a cosmic sense of justice, in Greek culture generally pushing humans towards greatness, and in Darwinian thought, the struggle is a crucial feature of the mechanism of natural selection and the development of species. This struggle for limited resources is not the chief characteristic of the overall 'economy' of life.

Cultural advancement happens through conflict; likewise, the history of scientific development and the development of dialectic in philosophy and ultimately of logic ('Socrates and Tragedy'); the best friendship is not an agreement but antagonism: 'let us be enemies too, my friends!', and similarly a good enemy is an asset; man and woman are said to be locked in antagonism; likewise the masculine and feminine, by means of which agon is symbolised erotically; Wisdom 'loves only a warrior' is a metaphorical evocation of agon in philosophical overcoming. The instinct for struggle is not always productive, however, and must be had or discharged in a way that does not threaten. This was the role of a state; in other words, the proper

 way for oneself – for the growth of other peoples' beauty and power, or of human values or behaviours. Therefore, the concept of culture can be used broadly, to designate types of culture that span dozens of nations and hundreds of years (e.g. ‘Alexandrian’ or ‘Hellenic’); or narrowly, to discuss individual peoples or sub-groups (such as ‘noble culture’ ). Culture includes everything from mundane practices (e.g. diet, daily routines), through institutions (church, military, education) up to ‘high’ culture (literature and art).

Culture is thought of as the variety of ways that the underlying Will has of keeping a people alive, and especially stimulating or tricking ‘nobler natures’ who feel the burden of being. There has a distinguish between an authentic and an inauthentic (or dispersed) culture, and similarly between lower and higher. Authentic culture can be defined as one that is unified, and which still serves a vital purpose of all culture, which is to produce genius or greatness. The dispersion of culture happens through the influence of the drive for knowledge, especially historical knowledge, which eventually turns culture into a mere patchwork of styles or practices borrowed randomly from the past, and without the dynamism to take on future projects. The Socratic drive for knowledge cannot be eliminated; instead, the task of culture is to incorporate it into a unity. This concern associates understanding the integration of culture and aids its development in modernity.

Furthermore, the concept of culture also becomes aligned to the conception of power but stays similar in essential respects. Higher culture comprises the feeling of power and the growth of power; indeed, higher culture always begins with barbarians, perhaps with contempt for and the destruction of a previous decadent culture, but in any case with the ‘lust for power’ and cruelty with a good conscience. Cultural advances depend upon power differences and the ‘pathos of distance’; in turn, this means that culture is a ‘pyramid’ with a broad base of workers. Contrasted to higher culture is one based on various forms of physical or spiritual narcotization or making ill (the ‘madhouses of culture’). It is this lack of a future, a lack of awareness that there could or should be future possibilities, that causes deeply disturbing.

In the beginning, Zarathustra calls himself ‘cunning’ when he refuses to reveal that he is using the honey as bait for the higher men. Such cunning, that is, has entered the philosopher’s ‘fishing tackle’ as serving his or her comprehensive responsibility for the development of humans into the future. This becomes explicit that where ‘perhaps’ cunning provides more favourable conditions than scholarship for the development of the philosopher – and again, the following section where cunning is the ‘kindness’ behind the mask. 

Cunning is also associated with the ability to find a way to preserve a diseased or decadent life. These two usages are not in contradiction but are a recognition of the amoral truth that not all battles can be fought in the open, with displays of force.

There is the idea of eternal recurrence in 'cycle'. Also, on a broad historical scale, there are repeated patterns of the formation of cultural forms of life, their corruption, the emergence of individuals and a slave revolution. In the life of the philosopher, there is a cycle of creative overflowing, followed by a period of exhaustion or convalescence; or, similarly, the investigation of dangerous and ugly topics, followed by 'running out into the sunlight'; likewise, Zarathustra repeatedly goes down and then up to his mountains. The symbols of feminine and masculine are also used as a means of exploring this idea. Finally, religious fervour is found with Folie circularize – Falter's phrase for what is now called manic depression or bipolar disorder – in its alternation of feelings of ecstatic redemption followed by severe penitence. Metaphorically, night and day, the seasons of the year, and the life cycle of organisms (the cycle of growth and reproduction, or of life and death) are employed to illustrate such cycles – along with associated mythical allusions, such as the life of Dionysus.

Dance is defined as a display of strength and agility, but one that is graceful, as if only a sign of still further reserves of strength and agility, which the description could also be of the noble. The ancient Greeks lived dancelike in this sense; dialogue in Sophocles has this character. Dance thus serves as an analogy for Dionysian insight apprehended calmly in an Apollonian vision; for the overcoming of shame in the healthy and beautiful body; likewise, for the conception
