Aphorisms is a brief, self-contained and striking piece of writing, usually gathered in sequences. Aphoristic writing was common in ancient literature and was employed by many authors. First, a random series of very brief sayings or epigrams, and second a series of longer pieces, each like a short study. There are a few added variations. Likewise, and regardless of the presence of an overarching theme to the series, aphorisms can speak to each other, as if they were short segments of a continuous piece of writing. 

The different rhythms of these various ways of writing and the different interpretative demands make on readers. The function of such writing as fully developed thoughts with either maximally compressed, or fragmentary, expression and an ‘immortal’ perfection of the form; aphorisms serve as a kind of test of readers; or an interpretative task set to readers, perhaps because the expression is deliberately incomplete.

Apollonian is named after the Greek God Apollo; this is one of three drives that it is a key to understanding cultural production and cultural change, from the ancient  Greek world on. The other two are Dionysian and Socratic. A  brief period in which the Apollonian and Dionysian work together produces ancient tragedy. The Apollonian is the origin of those cultural forms where beauty and clarity of form are emphasised (examples would be epic poetry, architecture, and sculpture), and the effects of calm or cheerfulness. Apollonian implicitly carries with it a metaphysical view concerning reality, that is, the belief that individual entities are ontologically original. Importantly, though, the Apollonian is also characterised by an awareness that these valued forms are an illusion to a Dionysian view of existence (a dream in which we are aware we are dreaming). Thus, the Apollonian should not be understood as a kind of self-deception or turning away from the real (that would be more akin to the Socratic). In his later work, the Apollonian is no longer thought of as a competing, brother drive to the Dionysian, but as a moment (of calm, stillness, beauty, image, etc.) within the latter. This is implicitly acknowledged that the ‘complete and authentic antagonism’ is between Homer and Plato: the former the deifier of life, the latter its ‘slanderer’.

The fundamental characteristic of things as they appear to us, including ourselves and bodies, is their givenness as individual form. This is Schopenhauer’s principium individuationis and the veil of Maya. Schopenhauer, in turn, was trying to interpret Kant’s distinction between appearances and things-in-themselves and incorporate ideas from Eastern thought. ‘Behind’ appearances are the will, continually striving and becoming, without form. Here, an important distinction arises between two senses of appearance: appearance as a symbolic image in genuine art, versus appearance as mere copy, and thus as possibly deceptive. Socratic thought is the forgetting of the first possibility of occurrence,  and therefore also as the advent of a modern faith in science. This theme continues throughout his career and involves analyses of how that which merely appears is denigrated for some ‘beyond’ or ‘behind’.

Human feeling is from the ground up, a simplification of the world so that it appears as intelligible, predictable, available for human beings to use. The ultimate motive behind this is utility: without such interpretations, human beings could not survive. Moreover, different peoples interpret things according to their specific situation (e.g. climate, resources, their enemies). Thus, differences in understanding the world arise, in terms of what is valued (and what is approved or disapproved of morally).

Later, the notion of value becomes fundamental. If one rigorously rejects the hypothesis of a world, God or life that is somehow not here but ‘beyond’, then ultimately one also must rigorously refuse the notion of appearance itself. Appearance only makes sense to something ‘behind’ or ‘beyond’ it. The idea of appearance becomes transformed into the notion of perspective or interpretation. A world understood as will to power is neither something in-itself nor is its appearance but is perspectival and evaluating. The building blocks of nature and very much, including the human, are perspectives or values – in other words, relations of will to power.

Convalescence means the course of suffering and surviving from illnesses caused by physiologies or cultures. The sickness led from cultures, in a sense, is by no means entirely metaphorical - that is ideas, beliefs, values, or modes of life that one has inherited and with which he or she is surrounded. When we talk about ‘convalescence’, it usually links to this second kind of illness, and its overcoming, in mind. Convalescence as an overcoming is thus contrasted to comforting as a relieving of suffering. Convalescence is also part of the cycle of creative states, linked to exhaustion and the need for repose.

A conviction is a belief, held stubbornly to be 'unqualified truth'. There is a notion developed by the dangers and origin of conviction that one must be a 'noble traitor' to one's convictions. Convictions are opposed by both the genius of science and justice. Therefore, those who embrace science and justice are considered as the wanderer,  a thinker who has no home or 'destination' (both understood as convictions).

Courage and bravery are an ancient virtue that we need to appreciate and revalue. Courage is the ability to stick firmly to life and the real, and not to borrow one’s beliefs and values from imaginary other worlds or modes of being. Likewise, it is courage not to manufacture one’s beliefs and values by a fearful negation of becoming, uncertainty and suffering, which are the conditions of life and the real. Such courage in the type is represented by Epictetus (the Stoic philosopher who had been a slave) and contrasts it with the Christian slave characterized by faith and hope in a different life. A few sections later, courage is proclaimed as a key ‘future virtue’: the arrogance to understand and not be afraid of the world. This courage is not dissimilar to generosity. Thus, the courageous type of thinker who is aware of the ‘cruelty of the intellectual conscience’, which does not simplify but insists upon multiplicity and perspective. Such courage is a form of self-overcoming. Zarathustra talks about those among his disciples who are too cowardly to change the direction of their willing and thus soon abandon him in favour of their contentment. Likewise, it is Zarathustra’s courage that tells the Spirit of Gravity to get off his back.

Happy because unconcerned with past or future, or not stricken by heavy thoughts (here, chewing the cud means focused in the present moment, not prone to nausea). The cow is also patient and seeing, and thus a metaphor for reading and interpretation as an art lost in modernity; rumination means to consider and contemplate without hurry. The cow is trusting, not slighted by distance or change; warm and reassuring like a faithful companion. The cow is an essential religious symbol in many Eastern religions: the ‘voluntary beggar’, learning contentment from a herd of cows, is a portrait of Jesus as a displaced and misunderstood Eastern sage. The cow’s calm is a possible and worthy response to nihilism and the degeneration of humanity.

There are two layers of meaning to the term 'creation'.  First, 'creation" signifies to the religious or theological terminology, but its use is not confined to such contexts; second, 'creation' is a slightly more 'ordinary' term about concepts, such as 'making', 'crafting' or producing'.

On the aspect of religious and theological meaning in 'creation', this 'creation' does not belong to us as individuals; instead, we are a 'channel' through which the will is the creator of art. This concept comes from Kant – the artistic genius of how nature gives the rule to art – but by way of a Schopenhauerian conception of the will. In general, then, creation is used when it is a question of the artist being a vehicle in this sense; or at any rate, having reached a victorious pinnacle of achievement that is miraculous to other artistic or cultural efforts. Significantly, this creation is associated with the production of a new future. Here is a contrast amongst contemporary artists and the Greeks who were 'creators of men'. That is, creation in Greece is not understood in a trivial sense as 'originality' and this scepticism has extended further: creation with religious and theological meaning is a product of human thought or development. However, it is a miracle and is thus assigned to the influence of the divine.

’ are not individual concepts or instances of isolated occurrence, but rather the universal character of the thing and the state of things. A key example is the concept of cause and effect in nature. Natural causality is replaced by the concept of a network of forces – that is with the will to power. This new concept of cause and effect in nature is accompanied by effects at the level of society, and then an equivalence network, first a purpose, then a principle.  The fundamental distinction among aesthetic categories is significant, to the extent that the difference is not trivial. There is an extended period of union after the fact, in which the union is an essential characteristic of the human type. This equivalence is a reference to the fundamental properties of matter; equivalence; or, equivalence is the principle of being capable of nothingness. In other words, values are not relative or arbitrary. They are the rule, and not the exception.

Similarly, beauty is a specifying ideal of the human type, where likeness is not an endpoint but a mode of perception – and the expectation of beauty is an essential condition for the growth of life. This beautiful thing is ‘worthy of’, but not entitled to, care. The need to recognize this need for a distinction is not apparent to be sure; instead, the ugly side of the whole thing.’. This recognition of pain and suffering through a transformation of health and function into a burden is an excellent analogy for the way suffering is symbolized in Polish culture. Likewise, the interconnectedness of all things and events, and the way that change is akin to lightning. These ideas about need and dispensation, and the connection between them, are mechanisms for keeping things from falling into themselves. The latter are often the two ‘big issues’, and the smaller issues such as the death of one’s way of living. Notably, though, such moral practices not in number, but rather they function as mechanisms for keeping other values and attributes in check. This is a discussion of ideas about the ‘niceness of being’, and the distinction between those who are called ‘bad’ and those who are called ‘great’. The concept of the ‘eternal child’, on the other hand, is not so much a concept as a part within the self. Thus, the concept of the eternal child is not something to be left behind, but ‘the flaws and     errors’, leaving behind errors what is beauty (i.e.     modesty  is clean and clean,  and humility is not ashamed of its height and stillness). 

The concept of the tyrant is also presented as a mechanism for making others despise you. This is a discussion about ideals and the ethics of power.  The priest is a human being made worthy of you. The equality of power is between the priest and the sheepdog; the sheepdog is a dog with a strong feminine. The dog is a fake, one that you can use to your advantage, and which has become your identity. The eagle is the true bird, the ‘greatest asset of the human’. The eagle is a bird of prey, and the ‘soul closest to the eagle’, and thus the soul closest to the eagle. The eagle is a pitiful ‘beast of prey’, and thus the ‘greatest asset of the human’. This idea of misunderstanding and weakness is both represented in the Vedas and in the Treatise of GM. This is an account of the intellectual conscience and the self-overcoming of the rational conscience.

'Growth' is the term used to describe an all- or very much all- existent reality. It refers to all the things, including the human, including the human body, and especially that human form of the human should change with the times. Likewise, change is the possessor of a ‘future’.

The concept of 'decadence' also encompasses aspects of the human as a whole, but it is in part a product of the stability of life and of the human. The formation of a new state is ‘grounded in the past’, and not in accord with this past. That is, the rise of a ‘great despot’. A new form of life would be one that has remaining to offer both the ideal of culture and the promise of new possibilities.

The idea of growth or decadence is an illegitimate one, involving a backtracking to past values. The effect of values is to create beings of the purest soul and most human form. The recipro spirit
