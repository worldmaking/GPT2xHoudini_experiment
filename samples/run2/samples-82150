 is to produce value in the world: publicly funded schools, teacher certification and further or higher education available based upon ability rather than class. Likewise, Humboldt had a significant role in the creation of the modern university, enshrining principles like academic independence, general rather than vocational education, and the close relation between teaching and research. However, such reforms were counter-productive, being founded on a Socratic notion of science in which knowledge is understood as information rather than a way of living, a way of thinking or involving genuine insight. The non-vocational system was serving a different kind of vocation: creating servants of economy and state, and merely reproducing or reinforcing the current system of values. Moreover, without a cultivated grasp of German, classical education is only ‘a leap in the dark’, and there is no possibility of a genuine or authentic culture. Education for culture is something different from knowledge for economic social or political roles.

Modern education, with its post-reform shape and the universal franchise, is an offshoot of modern ideas of equality and democracy. Education should be a privilege and not versatile, although this privilege should not be bound to the class. Universities have become increasingly compartmentalized, with narrow specialization, a lack of vision and redundant experimentation. Likewise, the historical sense pervades all education, including the teaching of language, taught as a dead object of study rather than a living practice, as ‘living through’ what one learns. In contrast, the philosopher must be self-educated after having passed through a variety of specializations, in order then to use them as instruments.

Many moral systems have a fundamental distinction between egoistic (or selfish) motives or acts and those that are altruistic. Altruism refers to an action based entirely on concern for the welfare of others. Thus, in particular moralities, it characterizes the highest of moral virtues, or indeed the basis of morality itself. Altruism is often claimed psychologically impossible. Altruism,  at best, is an ideal caused by suffering from a lack of love or care, a sacrifice of one aspect of the self for the egoism of another, to avoid a feeling of impotence, or gain a sense of power, a desire for possession, or an illusion propagated by those who see their self- interest in becoming a function of another, or of the whole. At worst, it is a destructive and decadent ideal. Indeed, altruism involves a contradiction: the moral demand for altruism for the sake of utility is, itself, not altruistic. The feeling for others, or their state, by great humans, is often misinterpreted as altruism, when in fact it is an expression of power. Altruism is the key theme in the discussions of Spencer.

The opposition between egoism and altruism is either a false distinction (i.e. there are only varieties of egoistic acts) or one which carries a negative value for life (i.e. an ideal of altruistic acts contributes to human weakness or degeneration). The removal of the distinction leads to a ‘revaluation’ of egoism. The value of selfishness is measured by the value of the self, depending upon whether individuals are the ascending or the descending line of life. There are, in other words, many types of selfishness or egoism which are ‘despicable’ (the ‘phantom’ ego); it is selfish to consider one’s own judgement a universal law, the ‘tidal waves of selfishness’ found in absolute ages, and likewise greed or lust (in unspiritualised senses). On the other hand, selfishness that is noble or aligned to life is a chief virtue, and the ground of much that one might want to call good: for example, love and friendship, magnanimity, likewise courage and trust.

Two complications should be added, however, to the above discussion. The first is that by selfishness in many such contexts means that selfishness is an extended sense of self. For example, as far as the free spirit has comprehensive responsibility for the human future, this future is an extension of his or herself. The persuasive model for this is pregnancy – a mother’s love and care for the offspring as an extension of her selfishness. Similarly, future philosophers will understand that their ‘destiny’ is everything, and thus ‘what do I matter?’. The second is that a conception of the ego is multiple; the simplicity or unity of the ego is yet another of the metaphysical or moral errors. As living beings, we form a social order of drives, all characterized by the will to power. Moreover, the notion of will here (the ego wills actions in its interest) is no less mistaken. Therefore, there are neither egoistic nor unegoistic acts.

The image of a bridge is conventional that it is an opportunity for overcoming (for growth, development, progress of some type), and it has value for that reason alone. Thus, the human is a bridge and not a goal. Also, the passage called ‘On Redemption’ takes place on a ‘great bridge’. The ascetic ideal is, for a philosophy, a unique bridge to his or her conditions of growth. The priests are scolded for believing that there is ‘but one bridge’ (i.e. a universalising morality and monotheism), and the tyrant believes all history has been a bridge to him. A more complex analogy of a bridge is used to discuss the idea of the Republic of Genius, which is understood as a goal.

Buddhism is an ancient Asian nontheistic religion. Along with Vedanta, it had a significant role in the conception of a future cultural mode of life, which was characterized by solitary suffering, temptation and abrupt ability to change. Thejam d'Onofrio is one of the few moderns who does not talk about Christianity in a negative way. The book is heavily influenced (although not entirely uncritically) by Schopenhauer, and especially in its third part plays homage to Wagner.

Benevolence is an essential virtue, although not one well understood previously. The small acts of benevolence that people show to each other every day and counts the sum of little pleasures they evoke as, collectively, enormous. This effect arises even though benevolence is not unegoistic, and indeed founded upon a feeling of superiority. Pity is considered as a form of malice. Likewise, benevolence is a virtue associated with clear thinking and restraint, with the ruthlessness often attached to unclear thinking and sentimentality. Also, benevolence must be founded on a benevolent inclination towards the self  – this anticipates several key later ideas, such as the notion of a reactive will to power that is based on ressentiment, or the idea that the noble has self-veneration. Specific moral affects in terms of will to power are well advanced. Benevolence is traced back to the enhancement of power. After this point, benevolence drops out of view, to be replaced by other notions of virtue, notably veneration and magnanimity.

'Beyond Good and Evil' is notable for a more explicit discussion than is found outside his notebooks of the metaphysics that underlies N's reflections on morality and religion (e.g. the concept of the will to power). There are also nicely focused chapters on faith and virtue. The book ends with an essential evocation of the figure of Dionysus.

The Old Testament is one of the greatest, certainly the most sublime, pieces of literature, and the record of a great people. The New Testament a distasteful account of a catastrophic turn in European history. Luther's translation of the Bible into German is one of the critical events of the reformation and had a substantial formative effect upon the history of German. 'Beyond Good and Evil' is full of references to biblical events and persons, either for direct discussion or metaphorically (i.e. the images of love, gift and sacrifice are allusions to the life of Christ).

The bird is a symbol of rapid ascent, of something that needs and desires to be ahead of its time, to show spiritual growth. Birds must also be light, able to throw off burdens. The bird is thus in opposition to the spirit of heaviness. The flock of doves is precisely chosen because it is a conventional symbol of gentleness and peace but combined with the bird’s lightness and need for the ascent, and this is unlike a herd of sheep or cows, say. The dove image also has significant biblical echoes. 

The eagle (Adler) is the most common bird mentioned in N. The most famous use of the eagle is the symbol of a healthy and honest pride. The eagle can view things as beneath it; this is both a specific comprehensive sight which is not an abstraction and honest pride. The snake is cleverness. The combination of these animals (the eagle carrying the snake) is something rare: those who have pride do not understand themselves; those who are clever tend to be self-loathing. It seems likely that they also represent two fundamental types of sexuality: (i) the other strand involves wildness or destructiveness; and (ii) the arising of a religious faith in comparison. This cleverness, seen as a characteristic of modernity (regarding

 is to say, life considered as the will to power (together with the feeling of growing or diminishing power) – is the preferred explanatory instrument. Implications include: First, that knowledge itself is not a knowledge of this network, as if from an independent vantage point, but a part within it; thus, the notion of perspective. Second, all unities are multiplicities (e.g. the soul is akin to a society of drives). Third, insofar as the concept of cause and effect involves the positing of separable unities (that which is the cause, that which is the effect), it is an illegitimate concept, meaning also that necessity and calculability have to be understood differently. A fourth consequence concerns the idea of ‘becoming what you are’. Fifth, just as the becoming (in the narrower sense of historical analysis) poses a challenge to values that presented themselves as unchanging, so the metaphysical thought of becoming poses a challenge to all values, to value as such. It is thus one factor contributing to nihilism, and a form of life that can experience joy in becoming is an essential new ideal. Sixth, there are several incomplete attempts from the mid-1880s on to produce a metaphysical argument that relates the concept of becoming to eternal recurrence. At least, eternal recurrence is a way of thinking about value in a world characterised by becoming, and thus by the critique of values mentioned above. A life that could be willed eternally would be the only possible remaining criterion of value – it would approximate being – and yet such an experience would also have to be understood as healthy and ascending. This is the ‘opposite ideal’ to the pessimistic or indeed nihilistic state.

The phrase ‘to become who or what one is’ is an adaptation of a line from Pindar’s Second Pythian Ode. The individual is a ‘piece of fate’ meaning it cannot be fundamentally recast in the image of some external (i.e. moral) value. To do so would be a double betrayal of oneself, a deviation or distortion of the life one is, resulting in all kinds of physical or spiritual degeneration. Nor is it a question of choosing to shape oneself in any way – for the individual does not have that freedom of will. In some sense, then, the individual already is what it is, or at least is already pregnant with itself. Becoming oneself is a needing to get out of one’s way, not to try to find out about oneself, and not to struggle, while the ‘governing idea’ within one grows. This idea of not knowing oneself is in contradiction to the Socratic maxim. This not struggling, though, means to align oneself with the fate of oneself – and this, in turn, requires an absolute honesty (although not necessarily a conscious one). This honesty will involve, if not self-knowledge, then at least the strength for truth more generally; also a specific act of creation, a questioning or critical attitude towards one’s age, and a refusal of external models of living (external to one’s alignment to fate), in favour of an internal adaptation. For this reason, also, Zarathustra requests that his disciples do not think of him as offering a way of life (‘guard yourself against Zarathustra’ ).

The concept of being in a way akin to Parmenides or Plato: true being is that which is, eternally, and does not become. Moreover, even concerning everyday entities, that things we know are not genuinely permanent or self- identical, we still employ the concepts of being, as if they were true being. Belief in the existence of nature is a crucial feature of metaphysics and carries a moral value.

Belief has two different meanings in both English and German. First, belief in the sense of opinion, the unjustified or careless views that someone or a group happens to have. Second, belief in the spirit of faith, often now in a religious sense. A religious sceptic would claim there is very little difference between them. Still, in many philosophical traditions, there is a significant difference: one can acquire evidence such that opinion becomes knowledge, but the object of faith could not in principle be an object of knowledge. The notions of a disciple, or the
