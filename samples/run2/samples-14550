 ‘migrated’ to the right (although not necessarily for the sake of some transcendent ideal). The philosopher-hermit does not live in a 'de-transforming' or even calculable 'sense' – rather, he or she is always ascending or 'entering' the world. Thus, there is only constant becoming that is going by the appearance of scientific knowledge and example to others. The cosmos is about 'no' ( genesis, no- self-determination, no- good feeling). 'One body, one mind, one spirit, one atom' is devoted to this 'eternity' and to the development of that which is 'wrong'. Sin, its historical innocence, is thus called an 'evil'. Moral systems, on the other hand, are designed to be 'good' and are in fact always about the individual; the system is built on the overcoming of established institutions and the alleviation of suffering. Questioning the morality of 'no' thus links the two periods of human human history: 'What now?'< – and 'What do now?', and thus presents the latter with possibilities of growth and growth of the healthy. The Dionysian invitation is not only a recurrence of past events but also a necessity now and then. Waking life is good because it tends to develop the various social groups involved. Sin is thus: 'I am the exception, and you me, the whole world must see and accept me as it sees and loves'.

The development of a situation and the development of the human thus happen randomly in the context of festive traditions. The struggle is a process of order and free from beginning. The struggle is a term of abuse – borrowed when in France the beginning of the story of the Tragedy is ‘a metaphor for the Inquisition’. More generally, this 'adaptation' is by no means always a positive one, as the philosopher-hermit does. Nevertheless, the idea of 'adaptation' is quite common. The theme of 'adaptation' continues throughout.

Comprehensiveness is a concept without a single term to name. Comprehensiveness describes an individual who encompasses and can employ a variety of different states, drives or types of knowledge. Thus, comprehensiveness stands especially in contrast to the specialization typical of modern intellectual life. It is related to the idea of the multiple (the human soul is various), and to the wanderer who has no fixed cultural home and sees and takes part in much. Comprehensiveness also describes the various abilities, all separately developed in human prehistory, that needed to come together to make the thinker. Analogously, it either links to the emergence of the comprehensive ‘individual’ who can live ‘beyond’ the morality of some old, decaying culture. The philosopher must be able to see with many eyes, to view things from many perspectives; to develop this ability of  ‘brief habits’—similarly, the ability to function concerning both science and other aspects of culture.

Comprehensiveness is thus a feature of a future philosophical nobility, to be distinguished from the nobility of a narrowly perfected culture, as well as from the anti-culture of the historical sense. This historical sense is a kind of comprehensiveness but without discrimination, without any setting of limits. Such an ideal requires dangerous experiences to enable judgements about the value of modes of life. Greatness is judged in fact by the ability for comprehensiveness. Comprehensiveness thus describes a height that is not that of abstraction and represents an overall responsibility for the development of the human, and which can use a wide variety of cultural forms and institutions as tools. Such responsibility will be able to take on all the hopes and disasters of the past and present, and still rise joyfully to greet the dawn. Thus, comprehensiveness is also related to the ideas of the gift and pregnancy.

When talking about concepts, philosophical concepts or the fundamental concepts of a religion or culture, it refers to, for example, substance, cause, virtue, sin. Any discussion of concepts, therefore, will also be a discussion of philosophy, metaphysics, religion etc. Concepts form a system – that is, individual concepts cannot be isolated but must be understood as a whole way of thinking (and living and evaluating), and likewise studied in their historically developing and repeating interconnection. Philosophical concepts are later and dependent upon the underlying values that produce language. Thus, for example, philosophical concepts are governed or generated by the grammar. Even the belief in the validity of concept-formation has philosophical implications. Concepts may also be able to influence those values. When, under the pressure of discoveries or critique, a concept gives way the result is memorably described as a ‘concept- quake’.

Digestion has several meanings. First, philosophers have always chased after the significant issues and ignored the closest things, such as the food we eat. His discussions of digestion, intestines or stomachs are thus meant to be suggestions as to how certain daily life practices affect the spiritual domain of human thought. Second, digestion is a metaphor for the ability of an individual or group to live with specific facts or conditions, which is about those who find life indigestible and therefore want its end.

Similarly, human beings in the modern period are called homo pemphigus because they can consume everything, indiscriminately, without benefit and decision. In contrast, the ‘coming philosophers will have ‘teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible’, meaning will be able to deal with – and indeed form a new mode of life out of – dangerous truths. Excrement, the product of digestion, is a strong metaphor also. Pimps and aphorisms are works of literature. Borrowing metaphors, is a mechanism for attaining significance through appearance.

The notion of ‘character’ has a long history of philosophers who invented or exaggerated or even dismantled the concept of character. Under the same banner is ‘newness of character’, which is a term of abuse. Nobility is defined as a ‘strong, courageous, and straight-forward character’. Folks who are mistaken about this are ‘wretched’, and those who are righteous are ‘kind and patient’. Folks are characterised as those who have power, and those who have power. The ugly side of such a theory is the implied notion that such changes are made merely because of people’s prejudice or circumstance. That is, if prejudice is a problem, then becoming more right-wing is not necessarily an opportunity cost. Being straight-forward is the correct response to conditions.

The other theme worth exploring is the role of ideas in culture. While extensively developed in ancient Greece, characterisation of culture is by no means entirely reliable. Thus, developing what is known and trusting in ourselves and our ideas. The development of human feeling includes but is not limited to the evaluation or interpretation of data, values, or evidence – being able to affirm the truth of something, or falsely assuming the role of ‘lies’ in an age of uncertainty. Culture is a means for affirming one’s place within the social order, and integrating the relationship to life through culture.

The term of decadence is in both a negative and positive sense. In both senses, decadence is the corruption of life and the world. The negative sense of decadence is that which is the cause of one’s troubles, or of one’s employment, or of one’s health. The positive sense is that which is more precious and specialised than either decadence or degeneration, and this is for a number of reasons only clearmounts.

In medieval culture, decadence is defined as a condition of health, and degeneration is defined as a mode of life that is difficult or impossible. Library of Alexandria, ‘On Truth and Lies’, sums it up best. Not all things are created equal, and indeed very few are, but decadence is most certainly a condition.

On the other hand, the essential character of things is ‘worthy’ of every fibre of our being. This is GOODMAN again about the diversity of conditions and individuals. Marketable differences, including consciousness, matter. If we think of life as being characterized by need or desire, then decadence is more relevant (and, therefore, worthy of evaluation). However, if we think of life as being generous and capable of any of these qualities, then the continuum is a way of thinking about the afflictions of the weak and the weak alike.

The concept of critique has both a broader and a narrower meaning. The general sense of critique is to approach an object, especially some cultural object, such as a historical text, objectively and without pre-conceptions, to understand it or evaluate it. Thus, today, we might talk about a literary critic or film critic, and a philosophy student might be asked to ‘critically appraise’ an idea. An essential historical influence here is ‘critical hermeneutics’, an eighteenth and nineteenth-century mode of study that viewed biblical texts as historical objects rather than as revelation or, at least, not as pure revelation. The discipline of philology here is, to a considerable degree influenced by early hermeneutics.

Buildings are represented a whole host of symbols here, involving the construction of, living in, decay or demolition of built structures. Most of these symbols are conventional and not difficult to understand.  Architecture occasionally is in a literal manner. Highlights include the concept about our diminished sense of the symbolic nature of building and architecture as will to power), and the observations about city architecture.

Butterfly is a vital image with far-reaching but not always clear implications. Broadly, the image of butterfly is in a negative, though also in a positive way. The critical meaning of the former is thoughtless living in and for the present. Butterfly is thus modern humanity with its newspapers and petty politics. There are two aspects to the positive meaning. First, the butterfly is childlike, innocent, and therefore able to relate to its world without the heaviness of values. Second, the butterfly is a standard mode of existence, lightly and laughingly affirming of its conditions and its fate. The butterfly, in this sense, is also eager for growth. The butterfly is used in this sense, but now with an emphasis on the problematic sacrifices that are the precondition of such growth. The idea of cocoon is about the Apollonian cultural drive being forced to disguise itself as mania for persuasion, but re-emerging in modernity.

Caesar is a Roman general, politician and then ‘dictator’ of Rome. To mention Caesar and Napoleon together metaphorize instances of something exceptionally free, characterised by scepticism and the throwing off faiths, a moment of beauty and genius. Caesar, the tyrant, is thus also an example of the opportunities and dangers of decadence, for the highest type is always ‘five paces from tyranny’. It is precisely that danger which is their condition of growth.

'Camel' is the first of the three 'transformations of the spirit'. Importantly, the spirit as camel is already a transformation, and not a default position of the human. The camel wishes the bear as heavy a burden as possible, to feel its strength and test that strength. The weights are those of the deliberate assumption of humility and self-mockery, confining oneself to a specialization, discovering dangerous or unpleasant truths, rejecting the pity of others, and overcoming one's overcoming (i.e. departing a cause when it is victorious). In other words, the camel is the free spirit as far as he or she recognizes these states as burdens; exhibits veneration towards the burdens, that interprets them as valuable; and, knows him or herself to be strong enough to bear them.

The images of cat relate to the cat family from domestic cats to tigers and lions. The lion stands for exceptional strength, ravenous desire, strong will to power, but is primarily destructive and only prefiguring creation. The figure of the lion is an echo of Plato’s analogy, where the lion stands for the thump’s element of the soul and spiritedness. The lion figures prominently hint the sign that the days of loneliness are over. Also, the symbol of lions is as combining power with gentleness.

The tiger is one of the animals associated in mythology with Dionysus, which explicitly refers to fat. The tiger’s wildness is not tamed by, but directly not opposed to Dionysus’ needs or purposes. As one lush growth of the tropical south, the tiger is a symbol of wanton and sudden destructiveness (always about to leap) and over-abundance (‘Homer’s Contest’). Thus, also the tiger is the figure of that sudden urge to traitorous injustice among the Greeks, which requires the state to keep it in check. This tension can be seen negatively as unresolved, lacking perfection or direction. The ‘higher
