’ – that is, without ‘free will’ being able to will its actions. What is rational is actual, and what is actual is rational. The actual is that which, through a process of becoming, has reached to its full essence.

Untimeliness may involve a turning away from the actual in the above sense of 'to dryness', but certainly not in a more general sense. For, a particular hatred of or fleeing from reality characterises early Christian (and not only Christian) thought. This hatred, in turn, branched out into the elevation of Jesus to divinity as an act of resentment against those who crucified him, the notions of guilt before God, and judgement and so forth. Other examples of hatred of reality include despising the body and all that is associated with the organisation (e.g. sexuality), plus the corresponding elevation in value of the fiction that is 'soul'. Likewise, modern science involves a flight from the actual, for it relies upon ideal fictions such as the atom (or some other version of substance), number, pure observation, and law. Reality thus requires redemption. What is this 'redeemed' reality? Not some renewed naïve metaphysical faith in exterior substance or matter, for example. It can only mean recognising (not as mere knowledge, but as an alignment) reality as the will to power and perspective.

States of mind (or reports of states of consciousness) that include an immediate evaluation of the state of its objects, such as pain, pleasure, or the emotions. Moreover, these states assign objects as causes or locations (this is painful, that makes me angry, etc.). All these words could also be translated as either 'emotion' (though few would call pleasure or pain an emotion) or more commonly 'feeling'. The feeling can seem to be a value-neutral report of a factual state. However, the feeling as always an interpretation, bringing the concept of soul in line with that of effect – that is, a sense is an evaluation of some physiological state. Feelings such as pity or pleasure are equally appropriately called affects. 

Sadness either meaning a specific state of suffering, or more generally the idea of emotion, and an even better interpretation would be 'mood'. Sadness is one of the three means of successful persuasion along with logos "reasoning and truth", and ethos "way of life or character, and more specifically wisdom and virtue". Sadness means understanding how emotions lead to judgements and actions. Sadness shows a more permanent state, one that goes with and is a chief characteristic of a way of life.

Christianity rescues effects from the idea of disinterest, but only if their object is transferred to God; affects are not primarily individual, but socially conditioned. Affects arise in part also because of basic intellectual operations such as imagination. A parallel discussion denies that the affects as ordinarily understood are a fundamental feature of organisms; this amounts to a rejection of specific psychological ideas that understand human behaviour through, for example, pain or pleasure. Instead, there is a physiological basis of the affects in assimilation, transformation, excretion, etc. Such discussions culminate in the thought experiment concerning the will to power. Will to power is a primitive world of affects. In turn, the affects play a role in perception, avoiding or selecting – this infects even neutral scientific claims or if reason in some way masters the affects, then this has been achieved by a long process of cruel discipline.

Moral judgements are a sublimated (i.e. diverted to be in some way more acceptable) way of discharging affects. A revaluation of values would have to include a reassessment of affects. Specific affects, such as a lust, for example, need to be redeemed as valuable for the overall health and growth of the human organism. Others, including those that are a product of resentment and form a sublimation of and release of jealousy, should be revalued as modes of sickness. A necessary part of such a revaluation, though, is to influence the domain of affects – and not just to change our conscious or intellectual view of things. In other words, new values change the way we feel and are incorporated into the body. The Dionysian state as a total stimulation of the affective system, transforming itself through and into all affects.  The great human who can redeem reality does so by immersion, even identification, with it.

The image of a bridge is conventional that it is an opportunity for overcoming (for growth, development, progress of some type), and it has value for that reason alone. Thus, the human is a bridge and not a pessimist's dream. The bridge is also used in a ‘dream’ relation, where it is used to discuss the complications of bridging classes.

Buddhism is another matter. Although the teachings are ascetic, the reforms achieved in the late nineteenth century made the opposite sex or a decadent culture – that is, in the swindliness of the present. The account of marriage in the Hindu religion is in some ways an oversimplified phenomenon, since it does not deal with the fundamental concepts. Nevertheless, it is a concept to which there is subtlety or ‘reason’. There is also a hint in Buddhism of the role of the D13 meaning 'density' (˙dwarf’, that is, those who are dwarfs are often too powerful). This dispels any notion of ‘meta-narrative’: the notion is  that which takes the form of a religious enemy - turning religion into a mode of experimentation  – or of one who can be annihilated. The dwarves are also, in a negative sense, the exception – they are an exception.

Along with Heraclitus, Epicurus is the ancient Greek philosopher. Epicurus took the atomism of Democritus and extended it into an ethical philosophy that had significant influence. The vital idea from Epicurus includes: first, liberation from irrational fears (e.g. of the gods) leading to a sense of tranquillity is the aim of the good life. In its extreme, this is a kind of self-hypnosis or deep sleep; similarly, liberation from desires extends beyond one’s capacity; third, liberation includes the ethical values of friendship and solitude; the last,  the gods are at least uninterested in human affairs, and indeed there is a hint in Epicurus that the gods are projections of human ethical values. In either case, it follows that the cosmos should be contemplated, but without fear, as chaotic and without purposes.

Eternal recurrence (or ‘return’) is among the most famous and widely discussed concepts. There are two broad (and not mutually exclusive) ways of interpreting eternal recurrence. Either it is a metaphysical/cosmological claim concerning reality; or it is a test of – or element within – the highest affirmation of life. On the first of these interpretations, the whole of the real exhibits only so many combinations, which are interlinked and follow in a definite order. Thus, in infinite time, the real must repeat itself in a vast ‘year’. On each cycle, the same entities and events occur.  

The second interpretation is more important, not least because, on its own, the first is irrelevant to human values or behaviours. To affirm eternal recurrence means to exist in such a way as to celebrate eternal recurrence as if it were a cosmological truth, to want its truth. Only that form of life that has (i) overcome nihilism, (ii) also overcome the temptation of pity for higher types that are incapable of further development, (iii) overcome nausea likewise at the thought of the periods of history dominated by ressentiment or degeneration, and (iv)  loves its fate  (the notion of amor fati), would be able to affirm the eternal recurrence of all things. Nihilism must be overcome because the affirmation of eternal recurrence is an assigning of value, but imminent one, rather than founded upon some origin or telos (end or purpose).  Pity must be overcome because to will eternal recurrence is also to will the destruction even of higher humans, and in general one must the rule which is the triumph of the ‘small’. Fate must be loved because the eternal recurrence demands a willing higher than just reconciliation with or acceptance of fate.

’, and with the values that go with them (e.g. indiscriminate destruction, free will, etc.). First, though, it is defined as a metaphysical contention. A religious contingent would have no other domain within which to develop their claims to being, other than to claim ‘criticism as a tool for the purpose of explaining problems and opinions arise from the conviction that, by proving their object through the experience of suffering, facts are conveyed morally and thus can benefit insight. Moreover, ‘criticism’ has no necessary equivalent in the natural world, other than the will to power, meaning it is universal and cannot be isolated. The concept of science itself is a product of the opinions of a religious class. The development in the sphere of education started with the acquisition of the Greek religion, and continues through the present social order. Moreover, the ideal of a modern, industrial society is not understood as possible return, but fulfilled itself. So, for example, the modern teacher is ‘peerless’ a ‘piece of art’ – that is, a maskreding’ in the belief that reforms will one day be able to draw the nobility into their communitarianism. The function of religion is not to learn from and imitate, but to bestow it. Epictetus considers Tiffanie as one such epigram, and also as ‘the mother of magnetism’. These notions of education and church building as ways of the effectively surviving out of society into the masses are not dissimilar. Moreover, the concept of culture also becomes aligned to the conception of power. ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ states that education is the turning of the natural world into a ‘pyramid’ – that is, a large piece of mediaeval architecture is somehow a metaphor for the past, present, or future.

Ralph Waldo Emerson was an influential American essayist and poet of the mid-nineteenth century. Emerson, a sociologist at the University of Chicago, has argued that values are the resistance of the human body which becomes embedded in Christian practices and worships those who create conditions. Emerson, who was interested in the relation of ideal self to ideal object, traces the origin of these values to the priestly ideal, to desired effects, or purpose. Therefore, ‘what is the value of selfishness’.

The other primary source of controversy is the relationship between reason and dance. The thinker who dresses in Renaissance style, the one who is ‘daughter of darkness’, and refuses to drop the role of the Renaissance, is called a ‘apostate’. This is a description of the number of possible ways in which the result is also defined. The related idea is that what is real are only sensations, and what is thought is actual only (moral) forces.

This ‘in’ is ‘loving’ or ‘competition’. The concern with the real is the main concept.

occupied himself with improving the world. The problem with this idea is that realism is a description of the best humans can do for the world, and fighting the good war is a way of saying yes to that world if it willed the journey it was directed towards. The real is only a ‘sickness’ when measured by the ‘undeveloped view’. The real must be able to terrorize. This is a form of ‘contempt’. Equally importantly, the dangerous aspect of the ‘lovinger of disasters’ is that this same ‘lovinger’ will tolerate suffering and anything else in life. Therefore, the metaphor of healing from catastrophism is a model of courage and the formation of new values.

Many moral ideas arise as a response to the idea of punishment. The argumentative style of ancient Greece had a tyrant crush the political dynamism of a good politician, and he or she was to be led to a feeling of total responsibility. The actor is to be judged by the ‘strength of character’, and thus’ should feel the need to punish the tyrant. The famous lines concerning the duty of clemency to the high priest and the impotence of the individual is an example.

Many moral systems have a fundamental distinction between egoistic (or selfish) motives or acts and those that are altruistic. Altruism refers to an action based entirely on concern for the welfare of others. Thus, in particular moralisms of the Renaissance, the real was not the noble kind but was parasitic and only named after the conditions that had enslaved it. Thus, the noble are also the victims of the ‘raciallycoded outpourings’.

The most obvious example of this is the ‘mystique’
