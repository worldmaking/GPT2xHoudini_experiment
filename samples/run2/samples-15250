 creative life without permanence and without the possibility of genuine association, is how Kant developed the notions of friendship, gentleness and self-control in the development of states. This development, in turn, is characterized by the idea of the not-self, and not- at all a passive readeries of the real: not- a future readeriness, but more akin to a genuine relationship to the future.

The concept of critique has a long history of practices such as reproofs, which are used to ‘critically dismantle’ an object (e.g. a medical procedure or philosophical statement) before it is analysed again. Theories of critique include affects, desires, or motives. Actors and vices can be thought of as sections of a system, with different kinds of sections, and different abilities to organise it. The categorisation of different sections into active and passive is not an 'atomaic', and can be used in combination to form a whole system. The analysis of soul and whole pre-eminence in science is valuable: while passive science is a hidden betrayal of the ideal, science becomes a tool – namely a condition of the rise of the individual – to humanlike.

To breed means to select reproductive pairs to emphasise or cut certain inherited traits. Bought characteristics can be inherited, which is an outdated concept of biological inheritance. If we think of breeding on a broader sense, as the inheriting of selected values by way of institutions (such as education or church), then it is more plausible—a school ‘breeds’ in the sense that it values and passes on specific characteristics. The concept is in both a negative and positive sense. In a negative sense, Christianity is a procedure for breeding herd-like features, and physical and psychological illnesses, into populations. The domestication aimed at by Christianity from the breeding (in a strict sense) aimed at in Hindu culture, but the process is not dissimilar. In a positive sense, breeding is how peoples came to be, by favouring those characteristics that enabled survival under challenging conditions, which then became virtues. Likewise, breeding is the taking charge of human development, rather than leaving it to lucky accidents.

The image of a bridge is conventional that it is an opportunity for overcoming (for growth, development, progress of some type), and it has value for that reason alone. Thus, the human is a bridge and not a goal. Also, the passage called ‘On Redemption’ takes place on a ‘great bridge’. The ascetic ideal is, for a philosophy, a unique bridge to his or her conditions of growth. The priests are scolded for believing that there is ‘but one bridge’ (i.e. a universalising morality and monotheism), and the tyrant believes all history has been a bridge to him. A more complex analogy of a bridge is used to discuss the idea of the Republic of Genius, which is understood as a goal.

Buddhism is an ancient Asian nontheistic religion. Along with Vedanta, it had a significant influence on European thought from the late eighteenth century on, albeit accompanied by several misunderstandings. Schopenhauer finds in the accounts of dukkha (suffering) and the meaninglessness of action support for his pessimism; likewise, in Buddhism, he finds the ‘solution’ to suffering in the renunciation of will. Buddhism is to be praised for its lack of theism and pursuit of the otherworldly, and its freedom from ressentiment. On both these grounds, the historical Jesus is described as a Buddhistic. Nevertheless, it must be judged as a passive nihilistic form of life.

Buildings are represented a whole host of symbols here, involving the construction of, living in, decay or demolition of built structures. Most of these symbols are conventional and not difficult to understand.  Architecture occasionally is in a literal manner. Highlights include the concept about our diminished sense of the symbolic nature of building and architecture as will to power), and the observations about city architecture.

The concept of necessity also has a long history of philosophical development. The Treatise of Parmenides has a discussion of this theme:

In the first phase, the philosophers attempt to solve the nature of man by proving that he is a passive, dependent existence. In the second, the philosopher looks to find a way of overcoming the human.

A primary distinction between the empiricist and the metaphysics of nature is notable. The metaphysics of nature is a distinction between the intuition of the highest good and the irrational fears of the religious world, and thus also between the two types of science. The first concerns the conception of power as a motive or motive at the level of values, and the second centers on the ways in which such conceptions threaten the function of the ascetic ideal. <|endoftext|>

Fear is a general term of abuse, used against those who interpret the physiological and psychological functions of the human or animal. Specific fears are found in various forms of life (e.g. from certain temptations), but generally confined to physiology and the fear of sickness. Nemesis is a concept with specific connotations related to the idea of the destruction of life in Hindu culture, where heroes are often characterised by a 'husbandry' or resignation from fate. Nihilism as a specific religion (including AIF) is not treated with the same scepticism.

The allegory of the cave is one of the most commonly used concepts, coming from a sense of a dangeroussvenom overcomes its object and sooncomes its challenges, explaining that the cave is the destination of false insight and creative strength. The metaphysical problem of allegory is treated in terms of the emergence of practical concepts of life, for example employment, human revaluation or formation. The cave is not just an 'open field' for dreaming, but a 'closed field' for the cultivation of a new philosophical imagination.

Abandoning oneself is a deliberate one-way departure from other lives, values, or modes of life. A Bandit is no longer merely an individual whobreaks established customs, but also carries with him a sense of belonging to a ‘caste’ (i.e. a social class that is distinct from, but also closely related to, other races). this is appreciated and adopted by ‘Dionysian and Bessirene’s shepherd and with the culture of Wagner.

Barbarism refers to the unintelligible sounds of non- Greek languages and thus effectively meaning ‘non-Greek’. Brutality also means lacking in any authentic culture, mainly where the idea is that such culture has been or is still at stake. The history of culture could be written as the turning of the modern from a danger to the savage, but also as the emergence of a ‘elite’ of moral and intellectual workers capable of articulating the values and practices needed for the growth of the human.

The concept of critique has both a broader and a narrower meaning. The general sense of critique is to approach an object, especially some cultural object, such as a historical text, objectively and without pre-conceptions, to understand it or evaluate it. Thus, today, we might talk about a literary critic or film critic, and a philosophy student might be asked to ‘critically appraise’ an idea. An essential historical influence here is ‘critical hermeneutics’, an eighteenth and nineteenth-century mode of study that viewed biblical texts as historical objects rather than as revelation or, at least, not as pure revelation. The discipline of philology here is, to a considerable degree influenced by early hermeneutics.

The narrower concept of critique stems primarily from Kant, where it has a specific philosophical meaning. For Kant, ‘critique’ means to investigate the basis of any human ability (e.g. understanding, judgement, reason) to discover both its fundamental, a priori principles and its limits. The laws are what gives that ability its legitimacy, which is to say a guarantee of its value concerning specific goals (e.g. the principles of the understanding make possible knowledge of the natural world); the limits define possible usages of the ability which are illegitimate (e.g. knowledge of a supernatural world).

The concept of critique also inherits some perspective from Kant. For example, it seems to be at stake in his analysis of Socrates – Socrates was incapable of turning the logical drive against itself. N introduces his new, modified sense of critique in discussing University philosophy and its association with the state. Here, he proposes an experimental type of critique. One cannot critique words with words – because of the account of the origin of words as described, for example in ‘On Truth and Lies’ – instead of life supplies the principle, and the possibility of living in accordance with a philosophy is its legitimacy. The philosopher of the future is ‘critic in body and soul’, although this is still, like the sceptic, only part of the comprehensive sense of the philosopher. Also, and again, truth needs an experimental form of critique; this is not the ‘self-critique’ of knowledge (the critique of words with words) but remains within the orbit of the ascetic ideal.

Traditionally, pity or ‘love of the neighbour’ distinguish the human being from the animal or ‘cruel and playful’ nature. More importantly, such moral practices are often themselves cruel or even founded upon cruelty, to the point that cruelty to oneself (asceticism) is accounted a virtue. This point is made concerning the reactive values of Christian thought. This artificial contrast between human and nature leads the emphasis on the role of cruelty in human affairs. Cruelty is one of the oldest festive joys of humanity, and we deceive ourselves if we think this has been left behind. Instead, every smallest step in the field of free thought involves cruelty towards oneself. And, cruelty now refines itself. More generally still, life means being cruel toward anything that is growing weak and old in us; likewise, greatness implies the ability to inflict great pain. In other words, cruelty is necessary for life; but not all cruelty – specifically, the cruelty often found in moral practices as ‘anti-life’.

Zarathustra calls humans ‘the cruellest beast’ and brings together several forms of cruelty: the pleasure at the suffering of others, the desire involved in the ascetic denigration of life and the cruelty in self-overcoming. The final item on this list certainly includes the cruelty to one’s intellectual conscience engaged in the pursuit of knowledge. The point is elaborated: having internalized existing values and traditions, the philosopher (discoverer of knowledge or creator of values) must be first cruel against him or herself. All these forms of cruelty, from the passive to the reactive, and on to the most active and internal, bring with them a feeling of power. These types of cruelty return more explicitly as the three stages of ‘religious cruelty’, culminating in nihilism – the sacrifice of God ‘for nothing’. Importantly, though, it is more obvious that by pursuing such cruelty to its conclusion that an ‘opposite ideal’ can reveal itself: namely, that form of human beings who can joyously affirm his or her existence.
