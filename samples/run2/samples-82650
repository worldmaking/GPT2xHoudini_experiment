 of the notion of pity. Christianity is a great treasure of the most ingenious means for comforting. The Christian ascetic priest cannot attack the underlying sickness that causes suffering but can combat its symptoms.

The primary condition of communication is the sharing of a language – a system of signs and significations. But what is signified is by no means either ‘raw’ (i.e. uninterpreted) experiences or things in the world; somewhat, these significations are changed by values. Therefore, having a language in common is dependent upon also sharing a set of values. It follows that communication of thoughts that depend upon a new set of values, or those values themselves, is the most difficult. Moreover, one’s values are a product of one’s constitution – for example, various inheritances from the past, including both cultural and genetic, the habits that form a mode of life, etc. So, to communicate genuinely new thoughts or values would be to transform the listener. There is the same problem with interpreting or understanding ancient cultures. Particularly to the ancient Greeks,  there is an aloneness that is difficult and perhaps impossible to bridge (‘Homer’s Contest’); alternatively, if it can be bridged, would result in a transformation of the present – this, for example, is the reason which gets repeatedly emphasised the Greek sense of religion.

This ‘pessimistic’ view of language is not the final word, however. That which is noble will have both a need and even an ability to communicate singular values ‘to men and things. Notice in these passages that the idea is expressed in terms of an overflowing of fullness. There is an echo in that passage of Kant’s notion of genius as having (among other things) the ability to hit upon a communicative vehicle for an idea that, in different ways, is inexpressible. This idea in saying that the purpose of style is to communicate states –  ‘I was the first to discover the great rhythm, the great style of the period’.

The concept of mythic symbols represents the mechanism by which culture might be unified, and thus share the basis for communication concerning that which is genuinely significant. Also, concepts of metaphor, symbol, and allegory as mechanisms by which communication might be able to surpass its built-in limits. So, for example, the ‘man of intuition’ discussed at the end of ‘Truth and Lies’ occupies a world where things are liberated from their bondage under functional needs and accompanying values. Furthermore, the concept of Dionysian can also be considered through this fashion. This ‘inspired’ state is thus key to the noble attempt to communicate to and transform others. However, the free spirit sometimes needs to avoid communication even to his or her closest friends, either to protect the self and its ideals or them. 

"God is such a bad communicator" - the joke at the expense of religious controversy, which was often over points of interpretation, and the recently developed science of biblical hermeneutics, the purpose of which was to apply the rigorous methods of philology and history to sacred texts. Such lousy communication leads to scepticism and atheism; it, thus, drives to the death of God.

Comprehensiveness is a concept without a single term to name it. Comprehensiveness describes an individual who encompasses and can employ a variety of different states, drives or types of knowledge. Thus, comprehensiveness stands especially in contrast to the specialization typical of modern intellectual life. It is related to the idea of the multiple (the human soul is various), and to the wanderer who has no fixed cultural home and sees and takes part in much. Comprehensiveness also describes the various abilities, all separately developed in human prehistory, that needed to come together to make the thinker. Analogously, it either links to the emergence of the comprehensive ‘individual’ who can live ‘beyond’ the morality of some old, decaying culture. The philosopher must be able to see with many eyes, to view things from many perspectives; to develop this ability of  ‘brief habits’—similarly, the ability to function concerning both science and other aspects of culture.

Comprehensiveness is thus a feature of a future philosophical nobility, to be distinguished from the nobility of a narrowly perfected culture, as well as from the anti-culture of the historical sense. This historical sense is a kind of comprehensiveness but without discrimination, without any setting of limits. Such an ideal requires dangerous experiences to enable judgements about the value of modes of life. Greatness is judged in fact by the ability for comprehensiveness. Comprehensiveness thus describes a height that is not that of abstraction and represents an overall responsibility for the development of the human, and which can use a wide variety of cultural forms and institutions

 of ‘becoming what you are’. Fifth, just as the becoming (in the narrower sense of historical analysis) poses a challenge to values that presented themselves as unchanging, so the metaphysical thought of becoming poses a challenge to all values, to value as such. It is thus one factor contributing to nihilism, and a form of life that can experience joy in becoming is an essential new ideal. Sixth, there are several incomplete attempts from the mid-1880s on to produce a metaphysical argument that relates the concept of becoming to eternal recurrence. At least, eternal recurrence is a way of thinking about value in a world characterised by becoming, and thus by the critique of values mentioned above. A life that could be willed eternally would be the only possible remaining criterion of value – it would approximate being – and yet such an experience would also have to be understood as healthy and ascending. This is the ‘opposite ideal’ to the pessimistic or indeed nihilistic state.

The phrase ‘to become who or what one is’ is an adaptation of a line from Pindar’s Second Pythian Ode. The individual is a ‘piece of fate’ meaning it cannot be fundamentally recast in the image of some external (i.e. moral) value. To do so would be a double betrayal of oneself, a deviation or distortion of the life one is, resulting in all kinds of physical or spiritual degeneration. Nor is it a question of choosing to shape oneself in any way – for the individual does not have that freedom of will. In some sense, then, the individual already is what it is, or at least is already pregnant with itself. Becoming oneself is a needing to get out of one’s way, not to try to find out about oneself, and not to struggle, while the ‘governing idea’ within one grows. This idea of not knowing oneself is in contradiction to the Socratic maxim. This not struggling, though, means to align oneself with the fate of oneself – and this, in turn, requires an absolute honesty (although not necessarily a conscious one). This honesty will involve, if not self-knowledge, then at least the strength for truth more generally; also a specific act of creation, a questioning or critical attitude towards one’s age, and a refusal of external models of living (external to one’s alignment to fate), in favour of an internal adaptation. For this reason, also, Zarathustra requests that his disciples do not think of him as offering a way of life (‘guard yourself against Zarathustra’ ).

Bee is a  Symbol of industry (thus akin to ant), building or swarming. Bees creating honey is a symbol of patiently extracting, accumulating, and concentrating, indeed committed to such accumulation and unaware of anything else. Gathering of honey is related to autumnal ripening or pregnancy.

Beer is particularly associated with Germany; thus, it becomes a symbol of a German way of narcotising.

The concept of being in a way akin to Parmenides or Plato: true being is that which is, eternally, and does not become. Moreover, even concerning everyday entities, that things we know are not genuinely permanent or self- identical, we still employ the concepts of being, as if they were true being. Belief in the existence of nature is a crucial feature of metaphysics and carries a moral value. 

<|endoftext|>

Belief has two different meanings in both English and German. First, belief in the sense of opinion, the unjustified or careless views that someone or a group happens to have. Second, belief in the spirit of faith, often now in a religious sense. A religious sceptic would claim there is very little difference between them. Still, in many philosophical traditions, there is a significant difference: one can acquire evidence such that opinion becomes knowledge, but the object of faith could not in principle be an object of knowledge. The notions of a disciple, or the ‘love of man for the sake of God’ should be understood as ways of rethinking the notion of religious faith in the absence of a transcendent or impossible object.

Belief often relates to metaphysical or religious concepts as being objects of ‘faith,’ that these individual items of belief are part of a system which serves one dominant faith, around which one builds a form of life. In this case, it is the faith of the weak that they someday will be the masters; because these concepts are abstract, not the concrete expression of the life of a people, this kind of faith is universalising and arises from ressentiment. It is thus one of the three dangers of moral superiority, the other two

 of Zarathustra that his pity may be leading him astray of Dionysus, the Socratic, where he means ‘perfect opponents.’. The beauty of the human is hidden, it can only mean aligning oneself with the fate of an already-existing class order. This is a ‘danger’ and is often called ‘a healthy’ class. The best kind of cheerfulness is always only cheerfulness in the form of cheerfulness towards oneself (‘the first necessity’), and then cheerfulness exhibits the characteristic trait of pessimism – there is only constant, shudder-inducing, and discharging, and thus pursuing, the belief in a god. The final idea is that the human soul, which was torn apart but is still compounded up and revalued, is the ‘spirit of gravity’. This is encapsulated in the word spirit: whatever one believes or has believes or acts upon – indeed, whatever is real or healthy in one remains soul, and whatever is crucified is to be revalued and transformed.

Similarly, what is real is something like a process, that creates and then changes various forms, with some overall sense of direction or an endpoint. Similarly, there is the same sense of direction or an endpoint in the idea of power is pursued that one might trace ancient resources or practices. Similarly, there is the contrast between several powers that are universal and redundant, and among other things, wisdom or virtue. This sense of the moral needs to first separate and make unify one's values and actions into a herd. This is part of the account of the freedom of the will.

The second aspect of creation is that the first act of creation is in the domain of values. 'Things' – what is encountered or experienced – are objects for an act of naming or valuing. So, the discussion of creating a new medical responsibility is not an ordinary nominalism -where things are assigned names without reference to any essence. Thus, to develop new values means to create new things. Likewise, and therefore, future philosophers' knowing is creating. The formation of a people and its culture determine the first acts of creation; later, in the context of the decadence of the former, nature becomes the provenance of a great individual. It is the right of the noble or the masters to give names, to make values; and this right to create values or give names is taken from the pathos of distance. The projection of these values in the highest degree forms an ideal – creates a 'god' in the sense of Greek religion or the over human. Analogously, creating creates creators.

A third aspect is that all creation must involve destruction. For example, the lion stage which cannot create values, but can create the freedom to create. This means both that creating from out of oneself entails a rejection or an overcoming of one’s previous state. That creation through values necessarily means withdrawing other benefits (and thus other things constituted through those values). Fourth, all creation is directed towards the future, not in the trivial sense of a sequence of time, but in the spirit of the growth of life, health or power; indeed, those who cannot create have no future, they are the ‘last human’. It is only through creation (in all the senses discussed here) that a future of new possibilities can open, and the human type can develop.

A criminal is a lawbreaker, someone who acts against accepted traditions. There are three essential ideas. First, the observation that changes or developments in-laws are made, often enough, because of lawbreakers. The ‘free-doer’ and the criminal will at one stage be subjected to the same defamation. Second, it is the concept of punishment that the notion of retribution from the fact that someone outside the social contract is effectively at war with that society; sanction is thus the criminal expelled. Also, this notion is pursued that our behaviour towards the criminal should not be founded on revenge, but rehabilitation or healing from an illness. Punishment is a means of keeping power by having the right to find guilty and impose the law. Third, it is about the psychology of responsibility, the state of having the strength to act but not having the power later to affirm the act. Thus, the portrait of the pale criminal. This idea is related to N’s perseverance or courage in passages. There is also a line of thought – an endpoint of the softening of morality – that denies all responsibility, and for that reason treats the criminal very differently.

The concept of critique has both a broader and a narrower meaning. The general sense of critique is to approach an object, especially some cultural object, such as a historical text, objectively and without pre-conceptions, to understand it or evaluate it.
