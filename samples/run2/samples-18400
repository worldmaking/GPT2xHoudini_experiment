The term education has a broader meaning in culture and thus is also employed to express the process of cultivation. However, it is often used as equivalent to Rehang. Education, and significantly higher education, was a perennial theme. 

Following reforms in the early nineteenth century, which were primarily led by Humboldt, Prussia had one of the first ‘modern’ education systems in the world: publicly funded schools, teacher certification and further or higher education available based upon ability rather than class. Likewise, Humboldt had a significant role in the creation of the modern university, enshrining principles like academic independence, general rather than vocational education, and the close relation between teaching and research. However, such reforms were counter-productive, being founded on a Socratic S-mathematical operation. Moreover, without a cultivated grasp of German, classical education is only ‘a leap in the dark’, and there is no possibility of a genuine or authentic culture. Education for culture is something different from knowledge for economic social or political roles.

Modern education, with its post-reform shape and the universal franchise, is an offshoot of modern ideas of equality and democracy. Education should be a privilege and not versatile, although this privilege should not be bound to the class. Universities have become increasingly compartmentalized, with narrow specialization, a lack of vision and redundant experimentation. Likewise, the historical sense pervades all education, including the teaching of language, taught as a dead object of study rather than a living practice, as ‘living through’ what one learns. In contrast, the philosopher must be self-educated after having passed through a variety of specializations, in order then to use them as instruments.

Many moral systems have a fundamental distinction between egoistic (or selfish) motives or acts and those that are altruistic. Altruism refers to an action based entirely on concern for the welfare of others. Thus, in particular moralities, it characterizes the highest of moral virtues, or indeed the basis of morality itself. Altruism is often claimed psychologically impossible. Altruism,  at best, is an ideal caused by suffering from a lack of love or care, a sacrifice of one aspect of the self for the egoism of another, to avoid a feeling of impotence, or gain a sense of power, a desire for possession, or an illusion propagated by those who see their self- interest in becoming a function of another, or of the whole. At worst, it is a destructive and decadent ideal. Indeed, altruism involves a contradiction: the moral demand for altruism for the sake of utility is, itself, not altruistic. The feeling for others, or their state, by great humans, is often misinterpreted as altruism, when in fact it is an expression of power. Altruism is the key theme in the discussions of Spencer.

The opposition between egoism and altruism is either a false distinction (i.e. there are only varieties of egoistic acts) or one which carries a negative value for life (i.e. an ideal of altruistic acts contributes to human weakness or degeneration). The removal of the distinction leads to a ‘revaluation’ of egoism. The value of selfishness is measured by the value of the self, depending upon whether individuals are the ascending or the descending line of life. There are, in other words, many types of selfishness or egoism which are ‘despicable’ (the ‘phantom’ ego); it is selfish to consider one’s own judgement a universal law, the ‘tidal waves of selfishness’ found in absolute ages, and likewise greed or lust (in unspiritualised senses). On the other hand, selfishness that is noble or aligned to life is a chief virtue, and the ground of much that one might want to call good: for example, love and friendship, magnanimity, likewise courage and trust.

Two complications should be added, however, to the above discussion. The first is that by selfishness in many such contexts means that selfishness is an extended sense of self. For example, as far as the free spirit has comprehensive responsibility for the human future, this future is an extension of his or herself. The persuasive model for this is pregnancy – a mother’s love and care for the offspring as an extension of her selfishness. Similarly, future philosophers will understand that their ‘destiny’ is everything, and thus ‘what do I matter?’. The

end or ‘cruel and honest’ self-discipline. It also happens that discipline is associated with the free spirit; this presents a further clue to the life of Buddhism. Discipline is natural, in that it arises from a necessity other than our awareness than is to be preferred. Moreover, such discipline as the careful treatment of sensuality in How to be a Good Dog is as a summary of the essential values of Christianity; it is also a synthesis of those values. Discipline as the noble deed; abstinence from passion; caution in the discharge of sensual instincts; a caution in assuming the pretence of virtue; an abstinence that does not become a mask; dependence upon another; a abstinence that becomes an instrument; and a discipline that is as long as it stays in accordance with the will. Such an abstinence is a kind of revaluation, a revaluation that is revalued. Christianity is a good-bye to the sensuality that was once its treasure it, and which is also a key to the Dionysian. Christianity is a great treasure’s chance for all things positive, primarily through the expression of strength in masculine and feminine. Furthermore, Christianity is the great human who can overcome anything, even if it is small – thus, it is the origin of the ideal. This courage is not in the form of a noble struggle, however spirited the contest; it is a reward for the fact that the tyrant has been  praised for his restraint and the strength to overcome.

The closest things can be considered with "good neighbours'. While the philosophical tradition tends to chase after the prominent and most distant questions of existence, and particularly of other transcendent or ideal presences, we should pay attention to this world and life. Because of continuous becoming, not only are these big questions hopelessly unsolvable, but even the ways of life typical of only a few generations earlier may be old-fashioned. Therefore, philosophy needs to refocus on issues of health, mode of life, the small-scale sociology of friendships, the family and other interpersonal relations, the role of architecture, educational institutions, etc. These conditions must eventually have an impact upon a thought, and upon the ability of thought to be critical or creative with respect to values. or

On the other hand, there is a necessity of thought for other purposes as well: the question of whether thought is a necessary or sufficient condition of health, for example. The welfare of the group must be preserved, and the natural state of health measured by distance. The health of chorus or character is never merely the being capable of distress, but also the ability to communicate these states to others. It is a modified form of the egoistic mentality that is a symptom of weakness or degeneracy, and not the characteristic feature of the herd. This talk traces a line of thought that tries to treat the genesis of pity or envy. The former is a way of thinking about the individual that is not part of the individual, but is a partaking of his or her identity, and thus also a unique opportunity for one's competitors to show their combativeness by proving their strength. The third possibility is that which is the appearance of the great event which is the turning of the tide of and battle in one. This appearance is always a moment of beauty and achievement, and not merely a ‘fine’ taste. If beauty is a term of abuse, it is an essential term of abuse. Its use is traceable both to the origin of the idea of evolution and to its consequences for human values and behaviours. The discussion of the succession of values and the succession of appetites that are associated with 'value'. In modernity, the chain ofemonstrative is matter of fact and irrelevant, although for different values.

The list of ‘important’ things is endless, but most of the time,  are about persons or substances, not even creating superficial appearance.

The concept of critique, with its different uses and drawbacks, is the primary vehicle by which to understand the underlying purposes of morality. The purpose of understanding is to understand (even understand) why an action is beneficial or what the cumulative effect is. Or, through a small but important but main purpose, is to give an idea of the consequences of selfishness or cruelty. Finally, through the presentiment of morality, and especially in modernity, the model of moral philosophy reproducing the Growth of Moral Positioning-post, is of vital importance.

Ascent is compared to flat-footeding or leeching from cows, who take refuge in the light of the absurd, right? So, what is the meaning of the Greek concept of 'highroad' or 'highground'? The 'highroad' is ruled by the notion of 'honor' and 'respect' so that successful human beings will be 'more like animals than humans are creatures of habit'. The country is also the 'slanderer’, serving ‘higher’ purposes. The story of the Israelites and the inheritance of Amor fati, the 'noblest book of the Bible', tells the final twist in the dual allegory.

A modern conception of space means the vast, mostly empty and cold distances between stars or planets – an excellent symbolic vehicle for his notions of the pathos of distance (‘too distant star’), the infrequent appearance of greatness, nobility, friendship, solitude (the image of the star emitting light into the darkness, also notice the allusion to solar flares) or untimeliness (‘the light of the stars needs time’ ). Likewise, it serves to convey the cosmic insignificance of human beings and even the chaotic nature of reality overall. Similarly, also the methods of astronomy are employed: not seeing the stars as ‘above you’ – that is not transcendent in nature.

In its primary sense, a 'science' is a scientific method of 'researching' information from reports, or from observations, by both naked fact and naked

data. naked data: the naked facts are what you are, not the naked views that are the result of wishful thinking. (As far as I understand it, this idea of 'interpretation' is contradictory; having both an essential and an essential rate of return, such that what is reported is often true, but often given value.) Pettigrew and Weingert report an idealistic and sceptical attitude to science that arises from the belief in natural processes and the limits of knowledge, and that what we understand is the result of an internal struggle within the body. We are made to believe that what we are seeing is a mirage, that external stimuli are just processes, rather than errors. (iv)

The concept of appearance has several roots. If appearance is a way of erasing the characteristics of the human that are not human, then the Christian spirit is a modified version of Plato; and the animal is a metaphor for the human that has been elevated to the status of animal; likewise, the biblical account of David waking the other Israelites up from their slumber is a crucial insight into the metaphysical ideas of sleep (Kant), and day (paleontology) from the happiness of scarcity. The unicorn is also able to communicate emotions. The unicorn is meant to be a symbol of a healthy and ascending spirit, not merely a conventional image of the human as a stagnant, infantile beast.

The term dream is used to characterize the Apollonian and Humboldtian cultures. The critical distinction here is not between dreaming and being awake; the dream is employed to understand a certain domain of culture, and particularly of art. The dream is a self-created world, one that is created to be aligned with our instincts of preservation and our need to justify our existence and our values. The dream is not merely an illusion – we can be aware of ourselves dreaming – but the validity of the beautiful forms that we dream are derived from their role in our health and our preservation, and not in their truth-speaking. In a general psychological theory of the dream, dreams are the way to make sense of stimuli through a retrospective ascription of causation. But this precisely is how we live our waking lives also. The analysis changes focus, to dreams as the space in which our drives act or realize themselves; again, this is like waking life.

Moreover, not only is waking life not a great deal different from dreams but that, to the extent that we insist on it being so, this is a sign of weakness – that is, a sign of strength not necessarily of strength but of will. Waking life is a product of our consideration of the whole of everyday life, of all kinds, people, and even of our own. Waking life is a product of our consideration of everything, of everything's having and of what we each have. Thus, the question of what kind of person is a person – and thus also what kind of human is a product of our consideration of everything. Waking life is not a question of proving or proving-right: having a part in our knowledge of life and things is. In a general sense, then, waking life is a question
