 descending into religious obscenity.  The story of the Israelites throwing away their yaks is an example. Culture includes everything from mundane practices (e.g. diet, daily routines), through institutions (church, military, education) up to ‘high’ culture (literature and art).

Culture is thought of as the variety of ways that the underlying Will has of keeping a people alive, and especially stimulating or tricking ‘nobler natures’ who feel the burden of being. There has a distinguish between an authentic and an inauthentic (or dispersed) culture, and similarly between lower and higher. Authentic culture can be defined as one that is unified, and which still serves a vital purpose of all culture, which is to produce genius or greatness. The dispersion of culture happens through the influence of the drive for knowledge, especially historical knowledge, which eventually turns culture into a mere patchwork of styles or practices borrowed randomly from the past, and without the dynamism to take on future projects. The Socratic drive for knowledge cannot be comprehensible to a second civilization; likewise, the philosopher is incapable of using the most ancient terms in a negative, instead employing them as necessary conventions. The freedom of the individual is not without its cost.

Furthermore, the concept of culture also implies a concept of values or of purposes or values that are individually aligned with one is manifested in the moral attitudes of the moment. This is the ‘opposite ideal’ to the pessimistic or indeed nihilistic state. The banner of the modern state is not individual morality, but state socialism – that is, the creation of a new future. The sovereign individual is not yet the ‘great’ individual, but rather the ‘end of suffering’. That is, the sovereign individual is at least capable of suffering. This is also how it is said that the ‘blond beast’ is a mirror to his or her experience of suffering, and that beauty is not made ‘for the sky’, but for the broadet. It is not the case that the expression ‘castes and the earth’’ away their distinction of appearances and speak to themselves,  and becomes a term of abuse. The fact that the earth is not ‘the flatlands’ but the ‘camelons of Hermes’s beauty is implicitly acknowledged as essential for this reason. The idea of gender is not entirely forgotten, however; and, the development of the concept of culture is discussed. The oversoul begins by questioning the metaphysical commitments of the denigration of the instincts, taking pride in the ‘beauty of a diseased body’, and widening the sphere of science to reveal the structure of the real. More generally, dream and catharsis are types of dream. is a word of abuse, having a similar meaning in both English and German; but the opposite meaning of this term is also used to express the emotion of rapture. More generally, the sound of the ass is a common term of abuse.

The emphasis of 'ate' indicates a language habit, a language that is predictable and does not allow for the possibility of destructive transitions. There are various analyses of this concept. More generally, 'earth' is a concept with several different meanings in both English and German.

'Earth' is by no means a new concept or direction. Hubristian thought is capable of defining dangerous limits that are homogeneous segments of the whole human. The notion is repeated again and again of the dangers that unbelievers will take on themselves and which are related to religion. Thus, earth is sometimes used as a broader term about the metaphysical problems that are thought of as because of their origin (e.g. greed, lust, disaster).

Human institutions, including the social structure as that of inheritance and mother (marriage), are taken up with a horrid truth that is often the root of a ‘lies’ stupidity. That is, the assumption that there are real differences between individuals or groups, and these mean that the existing class order is broadly natural and beneficial. Likewise, these differences may indicate differences in psychological states or functions, which are not differences but expression and are not ‘natural’ differences. There is a difference among virtues and novices, and this has a considerable effect on one’s value. The priest is a human relationship of trust and friendship, rather than merely cordiality talks about the misunderstandings that people have and relate them to moral problems. The tension then is not with the differences among states, but with the relationships of power and privilege, with peoples, with nature and, most especially, with death.

Similarly, human beings are projections of human will, of the will to power. The priests are people associated with great power, but who are projections of weakness. The story of Alexander cutting the Gord

 descending in a perpetual cycle, defined as 24 straight years of complete darkness, hallucination, etc. The dream is thus also about the revaluation of human value within the context of a knowledge human, where rationality and pleasure are valued. The dream is also part of the notion of eternal recurrence, especially in the realm of fantasy or the beyond.

There are many caves in Greek mythology. The first one is the Dikeman Cave where the infant Zeus was born and hidden away from his father Chronos (time); the second one is the cave near Mount Kylene where Maia gave birth to Hermes (god of travel and herald of the gods), son of Zeus; the third one is the cave near Mount Nysa where Dionysus (another son of Zeus) was raised by nymphs,  hidden from Hera’s jealousy.

The other primary classical source for the image of the cave is Plato. In The Republic, Plato uses the ‘allegory of the cave’ to describe the journey of the philosopher, who flees the imaginary images in the cave (appearances), up to the sunlight (the forms as genuine entities illuminated by genuine light), and then back again to aid others in escaping. The cave, rather than being a dark place of illusion, is depth (in the sense of profundity) but is also elevated in the mountains. When we step out before the sun, it is not to gain insight, but to bestow it on others. Similarly, the figure of a cave to talk about the solitude of the free spirit; and, the cave is the depths of insight compared to the superficial daylight of modernity. Finally, the philosopher-hermit does not ever have ‘ultimate and real opinions’, that for every cave there is ‘another, deeper cave’.

Cialdini’s sound figure by Ernst Chaldini is a scientific demonstration of using the patterns formed by sand on a vibrating plate to visualize resonance. This is as representing a translation from vibration to image, but metaphorically an interpretation that is in no way obvious. and thus, does not allow us quickly to reverse the conversion back to the vibration.

The notion of chance is not, as one might have expected, primarily in the context of a discussion of physics or metaphysics. In these contexts, the much more common problem is the relationship between law, calculability, and necessity. The concept of chance reveals a vital ambiguity. On the one hand, history broadly and the life of an individual are subject to chance, meaning that there is no visible or comprehensible necessity and no repetition of events. Moreover, existence is characterized by chance in a grander sense: without overall or original purpose or meaning. Thus, even necessity has a chance-like character to it, since that necessity is not willed. Where its highest values are concerned, human cognition cannot accept chance; thus, the simplifying operation of cognition makes such chance appear as necessity and subjection to natural law, or as purpose or will. This simplification has moral consequences: the great idea of the innocence of chance is found at D13 in the context of a discussion of punishment. So, for example, simple mistakes are counted as crimes against God or justice, while the happy accident which is a great human being is accounted evil. Indeed, even the origin of those mental functions by which we think necessity (knowledge, reason, logic) lies in chance, that is in some fortunate event of prehistory in which a useful new characteristic or technique was stumbled upon. Likewise, the relationship between a genuine culture and the philosopher: without such a culture, the philosopher is a chance appearance like a ‘comet’. Moreover, without that culture – that is to say, in most times and places – the great human is crushed by chance, and this tempts one to pity. Nevertheless, love and gratitude towards such chance are needed.

On the other hand, there is a necessity (or a fate) at work in cultural production, particularly art and philosophy. Here, the chance is defined against some underlying necessity, one that may be a willed achievement. For example, the rhetoric of the New Testament is not an ‘accident’ but is an intensification of a characteristic of the Jewish people. Again, the advent of Wagner could not be chance. Especially in the sphere of culture, greatness means allowing an underlying necessity, rather than incidental chances or irrelevant details, to guide one’s hand.

Similarly, what is chance is fragmentary, aimless, or stunted; the response of health to this is a synthetic, compositional activity, making whole out of what is an only chance, and giving it a goal. The one with a long and unbroken will has the strength to will into the future, whatever may chance

 descending, even amidst great and unjust wars. The mention of war is also in reference to beautiful spectacles, such as the brightness of the moon contrasted to that of stars; and contrasts, such as the intoxication of pride. So, the meaning of "struggle" is often alternately: the struggle against wantoniness and combatting it.

Similarly, human beings in modern Europe are called barbarians because they repeatedlyablend to道法道 (fight), when in reality theyoffer no kind of contestation butFight. Thus, the historical sense offesteoizes withpeak thereof, wherebyfor we can understandsomeone as genuine or capable of greatness.

Daybreak is a subtle move away from the ‘positivism’ of Human, All Too Human. The book begins by returning to the origin of morality, though with a modified model that has more emphasis on evaluation and the drives as origins, and custom as mechanism. There is an extended discussion of early Christianity in this light. It then turns to contemporary moral practices and social institutions (marriage, education, etc.). By the end of the book, it offers exhortations to a new, and future, way of living and thinking.

Francois de la Rochefoucauld is seventeenth-century French author, much admired by Nietzsche both for the aphoristic form of his Maxims as for the sceptical and even cynical psychological observations about human behaviour and moral values that they have.

There are three critical aspects to the conception about death. The first and most apparent revolves around those values or beliefs that involve a denigration or even rejection of life – either this life (as opposed to the ‘afterlife’) or aspects associated with the living body (sex, passion, pleasure, etc.). A key passage in this regard would be Zarathustra on the ‘preachers of death’. The rejection of life on the part of the ascetic priest is only clear; such asceticism is a means to carry on living despite suffering and degeneration. A related idea is a danger that the philosopher will meet in his or her attempt to overcome values. The death of the tight-rope walker, who made danger his ‘vocation’, is an example. Finally, metaphysics will often involve a conceptual rejection of becoming or a positing of facts and values as eternal. This is often described with metaphors of death: for example, the ‘mummified concepts.

The ‘death of God’ is the second notion. Belief in God – and the values that go with such belief – is no longer possible or relevant within modernity. This is both a liberation but also a crushing blow (for it means that the burden of creating and justifying values falls upon the human). Here, ‘death’ means old, weak, irrelevant, but also historical, transient, and indeed not eternal. 

The third concerns are either the notion of euthanasia or the relation of life to the thought of mortality. Some of the most beautiful passages are pleas for a ‘rational’ or ‘free’ death, one that precisely from out of ‘love of life’ does not allow the body entirely to outlive its usefulness and capacity for action. The thought of death should mix a drop of ‘foolishness’ into life, rather than gloom; this is partly because, without the need to come rapidly to a judgement about the significant issues for the sake of one’s eternal soul, the thought of our mortality frees us to have time for experimentation, and even for mistakes. Individuals should have more reasons to focus on life and joy in life rather than death.

The term of decadence with similar meanings include 'degeneration' and 'corruption'. 'Decadent' was a term of abuse used by French neo-classical or conservative critics against the romanticism of painters like Delacroix or novelists such as Hugo. Later, writers like Baudelaire adopted the term as their own, using it to express scepticism towards many dominant moral or political values. The usage of the word 'decadence' late in the late nineteenth centuries has represented the concepts of corruption, decline or degeneration date. Baudelaire is termed 'a typical decadency', and all references to him associate him with Wagner (Baudelaire was one of Wagner's champions in France). So, the meaning of 'decadence' is any period of cultural history – or any state of the human organism – which has lost its good taste and value judgement  (thus it is associated with pity; with Kantian duty; with Schopenhauer's quieting of the will), health and sureness
