 interpretation, that is without even the explicit recognition that they are dreams. Here, dreams are not the physical processes that are described under the heading of cause and effect, but beyond them, serve to disguise the processes that are supposed to be outside of them. The idea is that without clear perception, the kinds of punishment that a thought can bring, whether actual or imagined. Moreover, without a hint of metaphysics in the metaphysics described. Here, on to the way-saying-no-denial concept, and on to the notion of suspension of views, where suspension is a way of thinking about values as activities that may be affirmed or overturned by the conditions of their being. This means that the primary distinction among everyday values and speculative values is not even a distinction between them and the devil.

Buildings are represented a whole host of symbols here, involving the construction of, living in, decay or demolition of built structures. Most of these symbols are conventional and not difficult to understand.  Architecture occasionally is in a literal manner. Highlights include the concept about our diminished sense of the symbolic nature of building and architecture as will to power), and the observations about city architecture.

Butterfly is a vital image with far-reaching but not always clear implications. Broadly, the image of butterfly is in a negative, though also in a positive way. The critical meaning of the former is thoughtless living in and for the present. Butterfly is thus modern humanity with its newspapers and petty politics. There are two aspects to the positive meaning. First, the butterfly is childlike, innocent, and therefore able to relate to its world without the heaviness of values. Second, the butterfly is a standard mode of existence, lightly and laughingly affirming of its conditions and its fate. The butterfly, in this sense, is also eager for growth. The butterfly is used in these senses eager is a negation, and so is the vampire.

The term of decadence is, of, or for the disciple of the ascetic ideal. This ideal is secular, or as deconstruction would carbúdico means "without reforms". The crucial words in the place-ings deconstructed and for whom decon is a way of using the proper means of study than is renumbering or refinement. Thus, the term can also be used to characterize the phenomenon of decadence through revaluation. RECEIVE is a revaluation of the concept of value, which is thus broadly interpreted as restoring or repaying decadence. This is a revaluation of the need for faith or virtue, in the idea of what is at stake in an incomplete and yes-saying ideal.

The concept of critique has both a broader and a narrower meaning. The general sense of critique is to approach an object, especially some cultural object, such as a historical text, objectively and without pre-conceptions, to understand it or evaluate it. Thus, today, we might talk about a literary critic or film critic, and a philosophy student might be asked to ‘critically appraise’ an idea. An essential historical influence here is ‘critical hermeneutics’, an eighteenth and nineteenth-century mode of study that viewed biblical texts as historical objects rather than as revelation or, at least, not as pure revelation. The discipline of philology here is, to a considerable degree influenced by early hermeneutics.

The narrower concept of critique stems primarily from Kant, where it has a specific philosophical meaning. For Kant, ‘critique’ means to investigate the basis of any human ability (e.g. understanding, judgement, reason) to discover both its fundamental, a priori principles and its limits. The laws are what gives that ability its legitimacy, which is to say a guarantee of its value concerning specific goals (e.g. the principles of the understanding make possible knowledge of the natural world); the limits define possible usages of the ability which are illegitimate (e.g. knowledge of a supernatural world).

The concept of critique also inherits some perspective from Kant. For example, it seems to be at stake in his analysis of Socrates – Socrates was incapable of turning the logical drive against itself.

 interpretation of the Apollonian. The Dionysian, in its use of blood as the basis for new morals, is a product of the Second Vatican Records Acquisition. This Blood is a re-valuation of religious beliefs and values, which is often more apparent in modernity. Blood is also a possible symbol of power and the corruption that can result from ignorance.

Body means the human body as opposed to just any material object. If one rejects dualism – an account of the mind or soul as fundamentally different from, even separable from, the body – then bodily states are sensations, appetites, passions and so on, and thought and reason. In turn, this means that the one set of processes (those traditionally associated with a body) and the other (those usually associated with a mind) will require a similar set of explanatory accounts—this joint descriptive account in a materialistic account of physiology. The will to power seems to provide such an account that does not involve the metaphysical commitments of materialism. Moreover, these two sets must also influence each other (indeed overlap or coincide) much more than is thought. Importantly, the individual body is not necessarily the primary object of enquiry – groups based on gender, class, or race are treated as effectively one body. That is, certain groups are effectively a single organism. For example, the mobility and intermarriage of various human types vertically across classes, and geographically across Europe and beyond, has created mixed physiologies and thus also new types of cultural forces or possibilities.

Similarly, this account of the body explains with the concept of health or growth in both physical and spiritual ways, and with practices like diet, cleanliness, or discipline.  Through such methods, bodies can be developed (or made ill) through what sometimes calls internalisation or incorporation.

The sickness of the body, and a misunderstanding of this sickness, forms the whole of philosophy. The most obvious example of this is the denigration of the body and what are taken to be its characteristics: sex, desire, sensuality, potent effects of all kinds. From this denigration arise certain ascetic practices that seek to repress the body. To these counterpoises a ‘deification of the body’, the ‘development of a higher body’, or a state in which sensuality and spirit are ‘at home’ together. Part of the redemption of the body, then, is redemption, or revaluation, of the value of those denigrated characteristics.

To breed means to select reproductive pairs to emphasise or cut certain inherited traits. Bought characteristics can be inherited, which is an outdated concept of biological inheritance. If we think of breeding on a broader sense, as the inheriting of selected values by way of institutions (such as education or church), then it is more plausible—a school ‘breeds’ in the sense that it values and passes on specific characteristics. The concept is in both a negative and positive sense. In a negative sense, Christianity is a procedure for breeding herd-like features, and physical and psychological illnesses, into populations. The domestication aimed at by Christianity from the breeding (in a strict sense) aimed at in Hindu culture, but the process is not dissimilar. In a positive sense, breeding is how peoples came to be, by favouring those characteristics that enabled survival under challenging conditions, which then became virtues. Likewise, breeding is the taking charge of human development, rather than leaving it to lucky accidents.

The image of a bridge is conventional that it is an opportunity for overcoming (for growth, development, progress of some type), and it has value for that reason alone. Thus, the human is a bridge and not a goal. Also, the passage called ‘On Redemption’ takes place on a ‘great bridge’. The ascetic ideal is, for a philosophy, a unique bridge to his or her conditions of growth. The priests are scolded for believing that there is ‘but one bridge’ (i.e. a universalising morality and monotheism), and the tyrant believes all history has been a bridge to him. A more complex analogy of a bridge is used to discuss the idea of the Republic of Genius, which is understood as a goal.

Buddhism is an ancient Asian nontheistic religion. Buddhism is a dialectic between Vedanta and 'Rhetoric'. The concept stems primarily from the ancient world, but it is also used as the basis of moral philosophy. The concept of Buddha is an individual and voluntarist form of Buddhism, which is opposed to, or dependent upon, Buddhism. The concept has profound implications for European thought, especially within the tradition of Heraclitus and Maxims.

======== SAMPLE 3 ========
 interpretation of 'creation' has two significant meaning is that what is considered sacred is indeed to be generated or generated by the state in question. This idea of 'becoming' is related to the idea of becoming in the first sense of 'becomingling', namely at least partly neutralising or reassuring the aspects of the human type that are to be expected from our current state.

The 'becoming' of God is highest of all things, concerning the overcoming of the ego. Here, the symbol stands for the individual or group which has 'becomes' itself in the question of self-determination. Historically, becoming was a defining characteristic of a certain type of power, or of a state. The individual now is itself an object of desire, and this is now transformed into a concern for other aspects of the self. Thus, 'becoming' is no longer a question of claiming external properties, but a self- attaining to these. 'Becoming' also describes the relationship of the contemplation of suffering and the ascetic ideal to the self; this is now thought of as Dionysian; and Pius IX calls the process of becoming 'eternal'. These terms are 'Becoming', 'Ritual', 'Hence, The Display of Nourishment', 'Innervation', 'Dionysian'. 'Innervation' is an allusion to the 'Game of Thrones' (i.e. the allegories of the Tragedies), and thus is not even a parallel to any kind of real world. The real is thus presented as the creator, not as a series of trivial observations and observations that are memorably described. Moreover, 'history' is a false distinction between the past and future, between those layers of society who are conscious of their privilege and would tolerate such discrimination, and between the deliberately 'anti-Semitism' of the 'anti-Semitism' of the present, and the expression 'cultural Marx' (incorporates Engels') is possible only through a 'creative' (i.e. innocent) dream. Such a dream is termed an 'opposite ideal'. Othe is, however, the opposite of the dreamer is dreaming; instead, the opposite is the case: the affirmation of the opposite is the role of the home. That is, a 'dream' is a way of looking at things, including the real world, not as their absolute and unchanging, but as mirror images. Thus, 'what is in the dream is what is in the life, and what is in the dream is what is 'noticed'. What is in the dream is what is experienced and affirmed/created', and not what is 'discerned'. Thus, the 'what' is what is reported to you in the dream, and what is not so 'discerned'. What is in the 'what' in the dream is the account of the 'what' is what – real things, in which what is reported is what is reported – and what is reported is what is reported is what is reported is what is reported. Here, the what is what is reported is the actual being that is something that is given its being. The account of the what as 'disowning' does not in any way be a ' straightforward' course of action 'point' 'source' ', it is only Hera's test of my ability to be a 'daughter of God' and not a 'daughter of God'. My father was a slave, a fate that did not go to my ability to give a bad omelet to the pit lord. When I tell the story of 'telling' Hera to Zeus, I am saying to her that 'what you are saying is what she will after me' (Kantse). 'What is it she tells me?'. That is, a question per se that is not her actual self but also does not be afraid of the expression 'what' (that is, what is given after having been 'disassociated'). That is, 'what' is not what is given after a certain point of view – it is 'discerned' and 'what remains'. What is 'what' is not 'thing' but instead is ism a 'puter' or a 'symbol' of knowledge – and this is a 'symbol' in the sense of a philosophy, that is in being able to display a willingness for the physical world Knowledge-giving to human beings outside of reason.

Similarly, there is the metaphysical sense in which I am 'being'. That is, the 'what' of 'The Birth of Tragedy' is my critique of the 'what is' of the metaphysical 'what'. It is viewed as a good by the Church, whos Vatican is a Corporation that 'pays' for its workers to become weak and therefore immortal, and which can then use that as a springboard to other things. it is about the Church creating and sharing the earth with man-made overtones
