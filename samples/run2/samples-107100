 or to feel as sinful as possible, to perpetuate the severe condition. The quality of spectacle: the ascetic wanted to prove their power in the sight of non-believers (barbarians), and they are both spectacle and spectator.

Ascetic ideals’ pervasiveness crosses many aspects of human life. The chief purpose of the Treatise is not about the ascetic ideal per se, but either proving the inescapable nature of will to power or proving the art of interpretation—the various analyses of the austere ideal supply evidence for these. The Treatise then forms a series of studies of the meaning of the ascetic ideal in artists, philosophers, the weak and ill and in priests. The discussion of the philosopher is significant, for here the ascetic ideal shows its often-overlooked positive aspect, as the search for the conditions of spiritual growth and elevation, like the abstinence and careful mode of life of an athlete in training. Asceticism is a way of diverting the course of one’s life onto the right path, the path that leads to another world or after-life. This means, though, that asceticism is a mode of living that seeks to cancel out experience – but that is a contradiction, and (at least at the physiological level) must be only an appearance. That is, the ascetic ideal must be somehow a way of a degenerated life-preserving itself at all costs. The priest is a kind of ‘doctor’ to the sick, serving to change the direction of their ressentiment to make it harmless. Instruments to this end are described from sections 17 to 20.  This institutionalisation of the sick and weak is also a valuable separation of them from the healthy. Both science and historiography (history understood as a scientific undertaking) are complicit in the ascetic ideal; likewise, atheism which stays ascetic in its will to the truth. In the end, the ideal ascetic means that the will to power can will anything (even nothingness), but cannot will  – that is to say, the ascetic ideal is the last recourse of a diseased form of life attempting to prevent itself falling into a ‘suicidal nihilism’. How the dangerous aspects of the ascetic ideal are to be overcome is not focused on here. There are two clues: first, through comedy, that is through a light-footed, mocking irreverence; second, through the will to the truth coming to consciousness not as a principle but as a problem. Asceticism can be naturalised, that is a return to the original Greek concept of askesis (training), a discipline of improving strength and health.

Ass can be a general term of abuse, connoting above all stupidity and dullness or slowness. All humans, from a higher perspective, are idiotic. To the concept of ass, the distinctive braying is ‘i-a’, thus ‘jay’ or yes – the ass stands for indiscriminate affirmation, lack of taste. The ass sometimes replaces such meanings as stubborn, enduring, and even intelligent; as a weight-bearing creature, the figure of the ass sometimes overlaps with the more familiar image of the camel. The festival of the ass is akin to one aspect of the Greek ‘Dionysian’ festival – the suspension of cultural and social order; likewise, there are Medieval traditions with a similar theme. Also, the ass is made sacred in some myths of Dionysus. Moreover, worshipping the ass is akin to the final nihilistic stages of religion, but here in a joyous and festive spirit.

A modern conception of space means the vast, mostly empty and cold distances between stars or planets – an excellent symbolic vehicle for his notions of the pathos of distance (‘too distant star’), the infrequent appearance of greatness, nobility, friendship, solitude (the image of the star emitting light into the darkness, also notice the allusion to solar flares) or untimeliness (‘the light of the stars needs time’ ). Likewise, it serves to convey the cosmic insignificance of human beings and even the chaotic nature of reality overall. Similarly, also the methods of astronomy are employed: not seeing the stars as ‘above you’ – that is not transcendent in nature.

 or beauty is seen as sensuousness, that is as filth.  Cleanliness as innocence is, of course, also a reference to the blood of Christ as cleansing one of sin; the ironic point here is that the Christian idea of sin is what creates the ‘dirt’ in the first place.

However, the type of uncleanliness is not the worst thing; the worst thing is shallowness. This is a typical characteristic of modernity, especially in Germany. It is the product of a democratic community. The point concerns distance; that is, a herd is defined not by numbers, or cleanliness in an ordinary sense, but by thinking, speaking, and acting as one, and by assuming equality (e.g. touching). This is unclean in a spiritual sense because it must involve falsifications or simplifications, passivity, and weakness, and because it leads to a stagnation of the human. Thus, what is unclean is ‘common’. Once a work has been produced (e.g. an act done, a book published) then it is in the collective sphere; if saw at all, it becomes universal. Nobility cannot be judged, then, by acts or works. Only a noble reserve, solitude and self-respect could keep its spiritual cleanliness.

The emphasis of cleverness is on both a patient caution and on a subtle, hidden, and often inventive calculation bent upon reaping the rewards. The concept contrasts both with the ‘human of intuition’ in his or her abundance and beauty (‘On Truth and Lies’), with wisdom and with great foolishness. This cleverness, seen as a characteristic of modernity (regarding education, business or industry, scholarship and practical morality). 

Cleverness also describes those subtle tactics designed to influence moral feelings or keep religious practices or ideas. Likewise, it is priestly shrewdness that organized the weak into the herd by which the will to power is, in a small way, stimulated to life. Not all usages have these moral overtones, though. Cleverness lies at the origin or maintenance of the state and state institutions, and the agonistic institutions of Greece. Likewise, through the discipline of manners, a shrewdness even in the body can be cultivated. This cleverness is an element in those virtues that traces back to the animal.

Shrewdness is honoured both by the noble and by those of ressentiment but for different reasons. Only for the latter is it a condition of existence, of preservation. These notions of caution and ressentiment allow us to distinguish between the lower and higher concept of cleverness.

The closest things can be considered with "good neighbours'. While the philosophical tradition tends to chase after the prominent and most distant questions of existence, and particularly of other transcendent or ideal presences, we should pay attention to this world and life. Because of continuous becoming, not only are these big questions hopelessly unsolvable, but even the ways of life typical of only a few generations earlier may be old-fashioned. Therefore, philosophy needs to refocus on issues of health, mode of life, the small-scale sociology of friendships, the family and other interpersonal relations, the role of architecture, educational institutions, etc. These conditions must eventually have an impact upon a thought, and upon the ability of thought to be critical or creative with respect to values. This list very much includes the everyday things around us: for example, our daily habits, our diet, and where (e.g. climate, city, town, or country) and in what we live.

The cloud has no symbolic meaning. If the Dionysian has reappeared in modernity, then the Greek sense of the Apollonian must also have appeared. There the theatrical practice of disguising behind a ‘cloud’ the ropes and pulleys of stage apparatus alludes that things (e.g. a character being a god) are made to appear. This is known as the due’s ex Machina. However, this cloud is also an allusion to the Apollonian ‘cocooned itself away’; this cloud is also a cocoon. In addition, the cloud is that which obscures, or which is neither one thing nor another. The cloud is also, of course, the source of lightning either because it is elevated or because it is interpreted as fearful.

To comfort is to ease suffering, whether physical or spiritual. Tragedy presents suffering in a way such that we are protected by the Apollonian image (what we might call artistic comfort), and also that we understand that beneath suffering is an unbreakable unity and continuity of life (‘metaph

In its primary sense, atheism is the positive assertion of the non- existence of anything like a god. To be sure, nothing like a god exists as either an independent physical or a transcendent entity. If gods are symbolic expressions of human ideals, however, then atheism in this essential sense is changed by the commitment to the Dionysian model.

Abandoning a belief in a transcendent God is a step forward culturally. However, in general, the issue of a god’s existence is far from the most critical aspect. More important are questions like the following: (i) what does the need to posit a god’s existence say about the believer?  (ii) What does atheistic questioning say about the metaphysical commitments of the questioner? So, for example, atheism ‘today’ stays in the tradition of the ascetic ideal. Likewise, the hidden implication of theism with science, language or morality means that unbelief is often blind to its causes and consequences. (iii) What ideals are posited in a belief, or despite a lack of faith, in a god? The arising of a Christian idea of God is discussed, as far as Christianity is not the function of the survival, much less the growth, of a people. Moreover, Christianity is not just atheism, nor just any theism, and therefore atheism is not necessarily anti-Christian. Nineteenth-century English moral philosophy, for example, stays Christian even if it rejects theism.

Atomism is a theory of nature that posits as the ultimate constituent parts of nature small, indivisible particles that move, collide, and combine in space. The argument begins with Democritus and becomes an integral part of Epicureanism.  It is revived in the early modern period as the basis of many philosophical materialisms and mechanistic accounts of physics. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, atomism received a boost because of the success of the science of chemistry, and likewise its role in models of thermodynamics. As a comprehensive account of nature, atomism always had specific weaknesses, such as its difficulty in understanding the action at a distance that is gravity or magnetism, the often wave-like properties of light, and the whiff of metaphysics that hangs around concepts like indivisibility, indestructibility or pure substance.

Atomism has several roots. First, it is from the concept by the eighteenth-century physicist Boscovich - the effect of matter based upon forces – that is, without requiring an underlying positing of matter. Second, a Neo- Kantian (and Schopenhauerian) critique of the nature of matter considered as a large thing-in-itself (i.e. to say, an attack on the notion of
