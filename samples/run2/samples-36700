. To have contempt for something – that is, for one’s negative value judgement to achieve the level of a passion – is a mode of feeling power-over. It is, therefore, a primary drive. Likewise, the modern feeling that freedom is an absence of discipline. Equally importantly, the sense of power is a vital part of pity. Alternatively, self-contempt is found in empathy, as far as one projects one’s suffering onto others.

The devil has three primary meanings. First, it is common fears and traditional conceptions of evil. Second, the devil may be certain temptations, through which one might deviate from or be held down from one’s path of growth. Zarathustra’s devil is the ‘spirit of gravity’, while the sorcerers is ‘spirit of melancholy’ (gravity and melancholy are both variations on the word ‘Schwarz’ which means ‘heavy’). Third, the devil indicates the interconnection of the good and the bad, the positive and negative (i.e. the notion that opposites are not opposite). Thus, the devil is just God’s leisure every seventh day.

Although in philosophical history the notion of dialectic has other reference points than this (Kant and Hegel, particularly), the use of the term here is exclusively about Socrates (and by extension Plato).

What one habitually eats, and drinks has a relationship to one’s spiritual life – that is, on what we think and how we value. The traditional diets of various nations, the religious practice of fasting or the role of beer in German culture are ample proof. More generally, this is part of the concern with the ‘closest things’: the spiritual significance of the patterns of life that are usually overlooked by philosophers on the hunt of ‘big’ issues. The interesting part in diet is that it has a metaphorical counterpoint in the idea of ‘incorporation’: the way the will to power absorbs, digests, makes its other powers, values, or ideas.

Digestion has several meanings. First, philosophers have always chased after the significant issues and ignored the closest things, such as the food we eat. His discussions of digestion, intestines or stomachs are thus meant to be suggestions as to how certain daily life practices affect the spiritual domain of beliefs and ideas. Second, digestion is a metaphor for the ability of an individual or group to live with specific facts or conditions, which is about those who find life indigestible and therefore want its end.

Similarly, human beings in the modern period are called homo pemphigus because they can consume everything, indiscriminately, without benefit and decision. In contrast, the ‘coming philosophers will have ‘teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible’, meaning will be able to deal with – and indeed form a new mode of life out of – dangerous truths. Excrement, the product of digestion, is a strong metaphor also. Pessimists only view the world’s ‘backside’. Writing is, therefore, a necessity, like having to relieve oneself – which is a joking elaboration of the idea that ‘my writings speak only of my overcoming’. Third, to consume or digest means to make something one’s own, and thereby have power over something.

Dionysius is a Greek deity. It is employed with many features of the myths and cultural practices associated with Dionysus, either as anthropological reference points, or as symbols: the association with grapevines, wine and intoxication; the association both with harvest and with spring, and thus both with plenty and with sexuality; the fact that the tragedy and comedy competition was held at a festival to Dionysus; that Dionysus’ mortal mother made Zeus reveal his full divinity, and was killed by Zeus’ lightning; that as a child he was hidden and protected in a cave by nymphs; that, in some tales, he is torn apart but then reborn; that Dionysus marries Ariadne, after she was abandoned by Theseus; that he is represented both as kind and generous, though also cruel to his enemies; his association with lions and dolphins, as well as minor mythic creatures such as satyrs or nymphs; the reported savagely destructive behaviour of devotees during certain religious rites; and in general the association of Dionysus with joy and with release from labour or care.

The Dionysian is one of the three cultural drives in The Birth of Tragedy, along with the Apoll

. To avoid such a situation could be to keep oneself elevated;  and, the degeneration of human spiritual capacity is a defining characteristic of many  interconnected  things. An important passage is ‘On the degeneration of conscience’. 

The degeneration of conscience is not the cause of one’s existing conditions, but a mechanism by which we themselves act and are made to appear. That is to say, in the love of the self, endless possibilities are ‘bathed in beauty’ (i.e. beautiful ones; mirage). Thus, also the reference to eternal recurrence is not an ‘accident’ but is an intensification – that is, a setting up of eternal recurrence as the proper country or nation of human beings, and this is both a way of thinking about the country and also as a moment – a culture in which ideas and ideas are to be revived. Here, the butterfly is groomed – and now ‘iron and blood’ – by the idea of security and security in situations of need. Blood is also found for those who are blameless and not prone to pity.

Body means the human body as opposed to just any material object. If one rejects dualism – an account of the mind or soul as fundamentally different from, even separable from, the body – then bodily states are sensations, appetites, passions and so on, and thought and reason. In turn, this means that the one set of processes (those traditionally associated with a body) and the other (those usually associated with a mind) will require a similar set of explanatory accounts—this joint descriptive account in a materialistic account of physiology. The will to power seems to provide such an account that does not involve the metaphysical commitments of materialism. Moreover, these two sets must also influence each other (indeed overlap or coincide) much more than is thought. Importantly, the individual body is not necessarily the primary object of enquiry – groups based on gender, class, or race are treated as effectively one body. That is, certain groups are effectively a single organism. For example, the mobility and intermarriage of various human types vertically across classes, and geographically across Europe and beyond, has created mixed physiologies and thus also new types of cultural forces or possibilities.

Similarly, this account of the body explains with the concept of health or growth in both physical and spiritual ways, and with practices like diet, cleanliness, or discipline.  Through such methods, bodies can be developed (or made ill) through what sometimes calls internalisation or incorporation.

The sickness of the body, and a misunderstanding of this sickness, forms the whole of philosophy. The most obvious example of this is the denigration of the body and what are taken to be its characteristics: sex, desire, sensuality, potent effects of all kinds. From this denigration arise certain ascetic practices that seek to repress the body. To these counterpoises a ‘deification of the body’, the ‘development of a higher body’, or a state in which sensuality and spirit are ‘at home’ together. Part of the redemption of the body, then, is redemption, or revaluation, of the value of those denigrated characteristics.

To breed means to select reproductive pairs to emphasise or cut certain inherited traits. Bought characteristics can be inherited, which is an outdated concept of biological inheritance. If we think of breeding on a broader sense, as the inheriting of selected values by way of institutions (such as education or church), then it is more plausible—a school ‘breeds’ in the sense that it values and passes on specific characteristics. The concept is in both a negative and positive sense. In a negative sense, Christianity is a procedure for breeding herd-like features, and physical and psychological illnesses, into populations. The domestication aimed at by Christianity from the breeding (in a strict sense) aimed at in Hindu culture, but the process is not dissimilar. In a positive sense, breeding is how peoples came to be, by favouring those characteristics that enabled survival under challenging conditions, which then became virtues. Likewise, breeding is the taking charge of human development, rather than leaving it to lucky accidents.

The image of a bridge is conventional that it is an opportunity for overcoming (for growth, development, progress of some type), and it has value for that reason alone. Thus, the human is a bridge and not a goal. Also, the passage called ‘On Redemption’ takes place on a ‘great bridge’. The ascetic ideal is, for a philosophy, a unique bridge to his or her conditions of growth. The priests are scolded for believing that there is ‘but one bridge’ (i.e. a universalising morality and

. The argument is that these various ways that art has been historically employed since the birth of faith in medieval Germany, and especially in France, has produced a slave-like class (artist, engineer, or noble) which is capable of willing submission. Such submission is not productive, not even in its best sense. It is to be despised. The great human who can laugh at himself can still be sage.

The human has four primary ideas. First, that there are non- fundamental, fundamental, fundamental philosophical concepts in language that, in both French and German, use the term 'speech' here.  Second, that no longer requiring or describing 'wav' are the conventional images of a language. There is a significant tension here, between the romanticism of the ancient Greeks and the romanticism of the present- day as well. Thus, 'speech' in favour of the notion of 'speech' is no longer valuable. 

Similarly, 'craft' or 'craftspeech' are employed to understand something, 'history' or 'science'.  'Art' and 'craft' are employed to understand very old (and far more interesting) things, 'culture' or 'culture'. 

The third is the idea that the best kind of 'incorporation' is around the world: in other words, 'kindness' to the human already at a distance. Here, 'kindness' is a reference to the kind of people who want to be at home with and form a 'conscience'. This kind of 'creation' is 'crafting' or creating'. Thus,, creating is a 'craft' and does not involve humans in the sense of 'existing' as being 'comfortable' with their creation. 

The 'science of chemistry' – understood as the creation of new types of materials – is also involved. Thus, if knowledge involves the production of sublimated experiences, then science may well be 'craft' as well. 

'Culture' in the sense of 'house' or 'caste' is also employed. Culture involves the formation of a people into a caste or caste-like structure; and it is thus, constituted by and for the pleasure of having a language in common. Thus, 'caste' is also a slightly more 'ordinary' term by which we talk about 'caste'.' Any discussion of concepts, values, or practices within a culture must involve a discussion of 'caste' (described as being concreteness, concreteness in the display of virtue, concreteness in the lack of a superior). Likewise, communication of thoughts (‘saying hello’), character’s (meek and lowly), and future (‘those who know me well are great because they know how to speak English).

Causality is the idea that all nature is behind any one of several 'sources'. This is any process of having its origin in, or interpretation of, nature. For example, upon investigation of chemistry, gems of which are an obvious source of 'evidence' that chemistry is a test of such qualities as ressentiment, comprehensiveness, and comprehensiveness is causality. Or, if some are more obvious clues, they are revalued as ' discoveries ' of themselves. Here it is not the case that 'this world' is not there some underlying truth.

Control and Self-control denote reperching, among others. The idea of having control, especially over the self, is an essential source of the feeling of power. This can be in an ascetic sense, involving subordination of the self to an impossible or metaphysical ideal. Or it can be in the spirit of a productive subtlety in the war against oneself (self-overcoming). Self-control can also be associated with courage or strength.

Convalescence means the course of suffering and surviving from illnesses caused by physiologies or cultures. The sickness led from cultures, in a sense, is by no means entirely metaphorical - that is ideas, beliefs, values, or modes of life that one has inherited and with which he or she is surrounded. When we talk about ‘convalescence’, it usually links to this second kind of illness, and its overcoming, in mind. Convalescence as an overcoming is thus contrasted to comforting as a relieving of suffering. Convalescence is also part of the cycle of creative states, linked to exhaustion and the need for repose.
