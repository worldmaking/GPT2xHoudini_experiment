 the ‘evil’ principle and its overcoming by science of the metaphysical nature of the 'gravity' or 'gravity' of tragedy, which has not reached to a healthy level of the human. This 'history' is meditative; for example, the ‘alarmingly beautiful’ of Wagner's Ring cycle. The ‘hero’s slandered by Neruda for their infernal desires; the human is a ‘monster of desire’ who has no home or 'destination' (‘desires’); it is precisely that characterisation of the human which is both honest and rational, and which has placed herself in the group.iv

The notion of the slave becomes an essential one. There is a cycle of growth and power, and likewise of decadence. The noble are the slaves; the great idea of humaniveness is the ‘dictator’ of the whole of his or her life. Therefore, the higher human is a noble; naïve empiricistism has it even in its purest form. The notion of democracy is also involved. If the right to life includes the right to create values, then creating values is, itself, a human right.

The notion of democracy is distinct from the despising of others or the self-entitlement of species. This is manifested in the law of nature. All human beings are caused by the law, whether by upbringing or education. Moreover, the degeneration of human nature means that there is no possible way of restoring it to its former slumber. Thus, there is a need to revalue the notion of life. Moreover, the notion of the vampire is, itself, a danger to human future.

The concept of necessity has both a broader and a narrower meaning. The general sense of necessity is to discuss ideas like chemistry, philosophy, physiology, or philosophy of nature. In its extreme, the specific ideal is the overcoming of metaphysical and moral constraints. So, for example, the overcoming of the constraint of ressentiment. What is unclean is not the problem solver, but the notion that 'society' might be the proper term for an ideal (specialization, discipline, or privilege) that involves a denigration of all past values. 'Need for work' is a reference to an inability to work, even in the context of a productive creative act. Second, work is understood as the ‘innocence’ of the human, which is determined by the need to communicate to the gods. Third, the need to communicate is an essential condition for human happiness, and the basis for the development of higher education.

The notion of the beast of prey or the infamous image of the ‘blond beast’ belongs here. The ‘blond beast’ is the one who warns the way to find comfort in dangerous ground. The meaning of the ◊ in beast is thus revealed. The image of the bridle is a custom in Greek mythology. The beast of prey is the ‘prey’, making it a metaphor for humans not having as yet reached their full potential. The beast of prey is the ability to hit upon a recognisable speaking, writing or illustrating ability, and to communicate that talent to the next level. The concept of beast of prey also provides examples of the use of the concept of Dionysian. The human is a beast of prey, to be sure, but equally, incredibly, very different from, and repellent in its display of will to power. Thus, what were once the most obvious signs of weakness are now instead a typical Orcish signifier. The ‘dwarf’ is the other hand a different form of life,rier than the typical European. This is both because the ‘dwarf’ is also the priestly type, and also the type of warrior who is neither child nor warrior. The militarised and conservative form of human life in the nineteenth century and beyond was partly a consequence of the decline of Christianity from the mind of the human. But the result is a historical disaster: the redemption of the human from their pre-conceptions of the human.

The notion of the impotence of 'City' can be found in 'antiquarian' history, which is associated with cities. Such account at best serves life only as preservation and not creation but, at worst, 'mummifies' life. The city is also associated with the 'mob'. It is thus a place where wisdom is all but impossible. Therefore, calling for a revision of the standard architecture of large cities to ensure 'places for reflection' is quite vital. The city becomes a metaphor for a desire to depict, even in art, the ugly side of life.

 the whole of the real, not just to some extent, but to all real things. Here, on every allegory about the real, you come to understand that there is a deliberate choice and distortion of the symbolic image of the real.

Even your best love is only a rapturous allegory. Here, on every allegory, you are trying to find a way of seeing the real – and thus of pretending to see it. The illusion of perspective can be found in the fact that we refuse to have fake experiences, because this is the place where we refuse to be thoughtless accidents, and thus are worthy of respect. Instead, we can live happily ever after as if from the outside, without needing to think like this.

There is the idea of eternal recurrence. The story of Alexander cutting the Gordian knot is an allegory of eternal recurrence, but the same point is made about the allegorical nature of architecture. The real Alexander is, in a nutshell, a projection of human ideals onto the figure of architecture, and thus also to murals. The metaphysics of art, and the origins of all cultures, must be rejected as impossible because they are not exterior; they are 'imposed'. This is in contradiction to the dominant modern belief in liberal values of equality and democracy. Thus, what is unacceptable as 'new' are considered as unacceptable 'existing'. Similarly, the problem with 'modern ideas' such as equality or democracy is that they are often directed towards the real, rather than the metaphysics of appearance.

The traditional moral system of Greek society is to aid in the alleviation of suffering and a culture of self-love. However, this will involve, if not a rejection of the social contract as such, then at least the function of the worst kind of human: the one who feels duty-charged towards the self. Accordingly, even the best kinds of human are not the best at anything, and therefore also this is a kind of self-overcoming. That is, the best kind of human is one who can work towards becoming the best possible possible possible human from the worst kinds.

The concept of critique has both a broader and a narrower meaning. The general sense of critique is to approach an object, especially some cultural object, such as a historical text, objectively and without pre-conceptions, to understand it or evaluate it. Thus, today, we might talk about a literary critic or film critic, and a philosophy student might be asked to ‘critically appraise’ an idea. An essential historical influence here is ‘critical hermeneutics’, an eighteenth and nineteenth-century mode of study that viewed biblical texts as historical objects rather than as revelation or, at least, not as pure revelation. The discipline of philology here is, to a considerable degree influenced by early hermeneutics.

The narrower concept of critique stems primarily from Kant, where it has a specific philosophical meaning. For Kant, ‘critique’ means to investigate the basis of any human ability (e.g. understanding, judgement, reason) to discover both its fundamental, a priori principles and its limits. The laws are what gives that ability its legitimacy, which is to say a guarantee of its value concerning specific goals (e.g. the principles of the understanding make possible knowledge of the natural world); the limits define possible usages of the ability which are illegitimate (e.g. knowledge of a supernatural world).

The concept of critique also inherits some perspective from Kant. For example, it seems to be at stake in his analysis of Socrates – Socrates was incapable of turning the logical drive against itself. N introduces his new, modified sense of critique in discussing University philosophy and its association with the state. Here, he proposes an experimental type of critique. One cannot critique words with words – because of the account of the origin of words as described, for example in ‘On Truth and Lies’ – instead of life supplies the principle, and the possibility of living in accordance with a philosophy is its legitimacy. The philosopher of the future is ‘critic in body and soul’, although this is still, like the sceptic, only part of the comprehensive sense of the philosopher. Also, and again, truth needs an experimental form of critique; this is not the ‘self-critique’ of knowledge (the critique of words with words) but remains within the orbit of the ascetic ideal.

Traditionally, pity or ‘love of the neighbour’ distinguish the human being from the animal or ‘cruel and playful’ nature. More importantly, such moral practices are often themselves cruel or even founded upon cruelty, to the point that cruelty to oneself (asceticism) is accounted a virtue. This point is made concerning the reactive values of Christian thought. This artificial

Beauty is both a narrower and a more comprehensive concept: more restricted, because not all art has been beautiful as its aim or effect; more extensive, because not all that is met as beautiful is art. Beauty plays a role as the healing quality of the Apollonian illusion, which both protects us from but also allows some access to wisdom concerning the true nature of the world. This also means that the primary distinction among aesthetic categories is not between beauty and sublimity (Homeric epic is a relevant category within the Apollonian), but between both together and a third: the Dionysian effect that rightly belongs to music. Beauty is a late innovation, masking the shudder in the presence of the divine. 

Beauty has a decisive relationship to knowledge. Nothing is beautiful, but only because it is known; likewise, the origin of beauty may be ugliness coming to an awareness of itself. Because knowledge always involves projection of human values onto its object, and could only be knowledge of being, it is thus an illusion. The portrayal of expertise, as far as it must involve a metaphysical error, is beautiful; and the progress of knowledge is the transformation of the ugly into the beautiful. Philosophical reflection in terms of procreation and childbirth: the philosopher is pregnant with wisdom and requires a beautiful soul (Socrates) as midwife to bring this wisdom to term. The lover does not pursue beauty per se but gives birth ‘in beauty’. Thus, for example, history must be ‘overcome’ and ‘bathed in beauty’ for genius to be born. Beauty urges one towards procreation (either sexually or spiritually). The influence of Plato also contributes to the consideration of thinking of beauty as feminine. This feminine beauty means protective, preserving, approximating to being (i.e. relatively unchanging). The feminine and masculine become moments in an account of creativity.

Similarly, beauty arises under constraint or discipline. All these instances are further evolutions of the original idea of Apollonian beauty as healing, but also as allegory a form of indirect wisdom. For further discussion, see the entry under feminine. However, the beautiful can also be ‘wild’ (e.g. the ‘beast-of-prey beauty’ of the sea; the beauty of wickedness; or noble passion). This reiterates the lack of a profound contrast to the sublime as conventionally thought, the fact the calmness of protective beauty is a symbol and not a straight-forward property so that beauty is only part of a concept of life, which also involves creation and destruction. Thus, for example, ‘struggle and inequality are present even in beauty’.

Beauty is a quality of the ideal (e.g. the gods) that a human value sets for itself; thus, beauty is a human measure, ‘given’ to the world, by means of which it affirms or even worships itself. Thus, the metaphor of everything being a mirror to one’s beauty. The spectacle of ascending life is beautiful; degeneration is ugliness. As again in Plato, an attraction in itself is not the goal or endpoint, but instead either a sign of health or that which ‘lures’ one towards further creation (the soft voice of beauty and wisdom and life personified). Thus, for example, experiences are the seductress, teasing with beauty; or beauty is a culture’s imagined happiness; likewise, the beauty of the over human. Such disinterest is both physiologically impossible (or at least unlikely), but more importantly also a perverse conception of what is beautiful (‘immaculate perception’). Instead, what is given up for the sake of beauty is only the ‘hero’s will’, and this leads not to disinterest, but ‘godlike’ (rather than heroic) ‘desires’. In other words, disinterest is at best a stage, an overcoming of what is merely a fragment of the whole will towards the over human.

The concept of "Becoming" falls under two main headings: historical analysis and metaphysics. By the first is meant an exploration of the origin and development of beliefs, values, institutions, or other forms of life. For example, a 'science of art' that investigates the becoming of miraculous works. The significance of this kind of investigation lies in the fact that many values (moral values, but by no means exclusively) receive part
