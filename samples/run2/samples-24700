 ch. to connotes material gain or those values that are distinctive of an individual or group. Pity is considered as the person or persons being personified. Likewise, benevolence is a virtue associated with clear thinking and restraint, with the ruthlessness often attached to unclear thinking and sentimentality. Also, benevolence must be founded on a benevolent inclination towards the self  – this anticipates several key later ideas, such as the notion of a reactive will to power that is based on ressentiment, or the idea that benevolence is a mask for something more, such as the metaphysical feeling of power. Specific moral affects in terms of will to power are well advanced. Benevolence is traced back to the enhancement of power. After this point, benevolence drops out of view, to be replaced by other notions of virtue, notably veneration and magnanimity.

'Beyond Good and Evil' is notable for a more explicit discussion than is found outside his notebooks of the metaphysics that underlies N's reflections on morality and religion (e.g. the concept of the will to power). There are also nicely focused chapters on faith and virtue. The book ends with an essential evocation of the figure of Dionysus.

The Old Testament is one of the greatest, certainly the most sublime, pieces of literature, and the record of a great people. The New Testament a distasteful account of a catastrophic turn in European history. Luther's translation of the Bible into German is one of the critical events of the reformation and had a substantial formative effect upon the history of German. 'Beyond Good and Evil' is full of references to biblical events and persons, either for direct discussion or metaphorically (i.e. the images of love, gift and sacrifice are allusions to the life of Christ).

The bird is a symbol of rapid ascent, of something that needs and desires to be ahead of its time, to show spiritual growth. Birds must also be light, able to throw off burdens. The bird is thus in opposition to the spirit of heaviness. The flock of doves is precisely chosen because it is a conventional symbol of gentleness and peace but combined with the bird’s lightness and need for the ascent, and this is unlike a herd of sheep or cows, say. The dove image also has significant biblical echoes. 

The eagle (Adler) is the most common bird mentioned in N. The most famous use of the eagle is the symbol of a healthy and honest pride. The eagle can view things as beneath it; this is both a specific comprehensive sight which is not an abstraction and honest pride. The snake is cleverness. The combination of these animals (the eagle carrying the snake) is something rare: those who have pride do not understand themselves; those who are clever tend to be self-loathing. It seems likely that they also represent two significant mythic and cultural inputs into Europe, the eagle as the masculine Greek, the serpent as the feminine Judaic; their union is an expression of an as yet unrealised ‘wholeness’ of the human. The eagle is a bird of prey. Birds and especially the eagle, thus also stand for a kind of strength. Its happiness lies in relishing the terror of the great heights and the abyss, rather than in ignorance of that terror. Moreover, the eagle’s hunt is direct, straight down; it is thus, considered on its own, a noble ‘stupidity’. It is nourished on innocence, it both loves and hates the lamb – thus mirroring the relationship to the human, which is loved because of its yet unspoiled possibilities.

‘The Birth of Tragedy’, with its lack of scholarly apparatus, energetic and figure-laden prose, philosophical and psychological speculation, and a mixture of ancient and modern contexts, was not what the philological community expected. It has three primary purposes and correspondingly divides into three sections. First, to elaborate a theory of ancient Greek tragedy as a synthesis of two metaphysically understood cultural drives (Apollonian and Dionysian). In this way, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ solves the relationship between cheerfulness and pessimism ingeniously - how could the Greeks, with their in-depth knowledge of suffering and futility, have remained cheerful? Second, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ traces the reasons for the decline of tragedy to a third drive, the Socratic, which is also the advent of science and modernity. Third, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ seeks to understand what it would mean, and what it would take, for tragedy to be reborn in the present. The account of culture is thus revealed to be a general

 ch. beast and beast of prey ). Here, ‘beast’ also means 'erroneous' or 'uncommon'. Blood is that which makes one strong and capable of creating so that we have the vampire or leech images; blood is also the allusion to the life of Jesus; and, the possibility of a ‘great and unjust return’ to his/her former self.

The sickness of the blood have essentially the same meanings as the ‘disease’ of the suffering,latte-draining sense of hatred. If there is a distinction to be drawn from the positive one, this has been simplified to say that a sickness of the body gives it the negative aspect and a unique identity as a feature of culture, this is because it is a key to understanding the philosopher. Likewise, the sickness of the will means that people have difficulty recognising and accepting reality. also, the ‘giant of Undead’ has a negative connotation, as the Undead子 are prevented from significant in the growth of a people.

The sickness of the soul means that people have difficulty understanding or reproducing, or even understanding how the body works or how one absorbs or uses substances. It is this inability to understand or understand another is a sign of decadence.

Most of the above could serve as an account of the notion of degeneration or corruption also. If there is a distinction to be drawn from the above sense of degeneration, it is primarily because of the absence of a other: for example, the ‘lust for power' means that the 'deep' or ‘undesirable' traits of the human are expressed as weakness, cowardliness or invective. Likewise, the degeneration of individuals and groups.

Body means the human material environment including the physical, cultural and symbolic (i.e. religious) realm of human behaviour and values. It is used also to express concern for the health or growth of the human organism or the over human.

The word 'mob' has the same meaning as 'mob-ness' – it is a connoting of group identity and the overall 'mob'. Thus, the 'mob is not part of the total', that is 'I am an individual piece of paper – I am a part of a collective will to power'.  The mob is always just as much a part of the self as is the blood of Christ is the same as that of Jesus, and it is ‘the last convalescence’. Christianity is a great treasure of the most ingenious means for crushing the good passions.

The 'spirit of gravity' is the same as the 'gravity of gravity' in 'gravity' but with the exception of 'gravity' in the sense of gravity in a different sense and with a different purpose. This 'spirit of gravity' is always the whole of the philosopher when he or she talks about the 'vocation of the philosopher' or 'essence of truth' – there is no real distinction between the two.

The concept of spirit or spirit of gravity also appears in Kant.

In modern thought, the individual is a material and ins- OUTSMIOTABLE part of the human. It is also the 'society' that Jesus talks about ‘where all existence is cowered in dirt'. Because of this, communication is very much an art ‘where knowledge is the only guarantee of survival, in the form of a culture of knowledgemediated’, and as the basis of human future development. Agon means 'contest' or 'strife' in modern English, and 'strife and peace' in Greek mythology. The struggle for essence is also called ‘antiquarian’. Other times, however, it is associated with the excesses of-inity and rancour, and is said to be impotent rage. Agon is the ‘spirit of gravity’ in the idea that gravity is all-or-nothing in that it is based upon some indivisible fixed mass, and nothingness is experienced as distinct from anything. Nothing is eternal, nothing is eternity. Nothingness is the ‘essence’ of the highest good, and nothingness is everything. If one rigorously rejects the notion of boundless positing of greatness, then certainly nothing is. However, we should stress that nothingness is only the character of a proper mode of life. The highest form of life would be one that is aware and capable of

 chofmanship or inexperience that one is when it is courage and not scepticism. Notably, the tiger is not afraid of God; it is the antiseratures of the gods. Thus, those who are called 'the champions of virtue' are often the first to feel the effects of the great depression. The anarchists are, then, anarchists in character; the anarchistic twist is a product of the questioning of values posed by tragedy or comedy. The Anarchistic Character of Action

An anarchistic character is a character who acts as if he or she had no conscience at all. This is a reflection of a certain organ system, which considers people, but not objects, and not drives. An anarchistic character would be able to feel for objects, such as food, and not be tempted by greed – this is a description of the anarchistic character of his or her creators. An anarchistic character may be thought of as someone who can feel for and take charge of an idea or circumstance, rather than having its negative and positive points of view. An anarchistic character of the type we find in Plato is also able to have the positive feelings in the form of a conscience.

An anarchistic character of the kind we find in Emerson or Emersonite is more obvious. In all these cases, a defining characteristic of a dominant type is a belief in a god (‘eternal God), and a belief in a future of distress. The anthropomorphic character also believes that things are formed of pure nature and are capable of joyous coexistence.

Anthropomorphism means to impose the form of something onto something, especially something like a book. If someone brings a book with them, everything around will be a book – but this is a metaphorical footsold, and doing so is like a chore. There will also be practical implications: one book of a psychological model is like having a comprehensive knowledge of the world, and a responsibility towards the future. The metaphysically presented book is also called a book of mirrors. Pity is compared to the suffering of a dream, as the dream is encapsulated in a book. Instead, a dream is precisely the immersion into the real, and a grateful heaven is the depths of the dream.

At a stage of human development before the formation of any social order, the concept of art is by no means entirely irrelevant. In fact, this last idea is already a theme for a). Platonic art is incapable of feeling shame, guilt, or pleasure. B) Instead, we have a ‘art of life’, in which we depict and illustrate a future. This is realist, as the formation of a family and child is represented by chance, and likenesses with cimoleons and austere ideals. The represented characteristics of a real family or civilization: ancient Rome represented by a deliberate policy to humiliate and cut social outbursts. C) In other words, decadence is a phenomenon of the discipline of manners (ii-iii).

The decadent feel free to caricature or transform virtually anything, from the diet of history to architecture. This is harmless pruning. However, education and other social institutions can have effects on an individual. Thus, ‘respect for the person, is intellectual power envy’. 

Culture can be found on all levels of the human, from the very ground of beliefs and institutions. It is a means of keeping power by having the right to find guilty and impose the law. Likewise, educationally a ‘disappointed’ awakening. The concept of culture can be found in Kant, Schopenhauer, and Engels. Cultural advances occur through the influence of eventsional moments, or through the leadership of peers. Music, again, is a distribution of power.

Culture is thought of as the variety of ways that the underlying Will has of keeping a people alive, and especially stimulating or tricking ‘nobler natures’ who feel the burden of being. There has a distinguish between an authentic and an inauthentic (or dispersed) culture, and similarly between lower and higher. Authentic culture can be defined as one that is unified, and which still serves a vital purpose of all culture, which is to produce genius or greatness. The dispersion of culture happens through the influence of the drive for knowledge, especially historical knowledge, which eventually turns culture into a mere patchwork of styles or practices borrowed randomly from the past, and without the dynamism to take on future projects. The Socratic drive for knowledge cannot be eliminated; instead, the task of culture is to incorporate it into a unity. This concern associates understanding the integration of culture and aids its development in modernity.

Furthermore, the concept of culture also becomes aligned to the conception of power but stays similar in essential respects. Higher culture comprises the feeling of power and the growth of power; indeed, higher culture always begins with
