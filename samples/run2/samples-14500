it-mother will say, 'But Jesus was crucified, why are you here? Because I have become a slave of your pity and slandered pity'. 

This is related to the contrast between the ‘small’ and the ‘great’ (the two are a category within a broad network). The former is necessary and essential, the goal behind the appearance of homogeneity (history and morality), and the result of creativity (strength of will). The latter is an illusion produced by the best efforts of the weak and downtrodden, and which is a symptom of individual weakness or ignorance. In both these cases, the result is a positive movement in and of itself, but more importantly, a moving towards the integration of human beings into the unity of the whole of life.

The highest culture is one that includes the creation of individuals and groups, which is a process – an accumulation of power – and is thus subject to noetic and purification. The purification of culture is a vital one, taking the form of classes, or social classes. The purification of society then is a 'triumphant labour of rehabilitation' that 'dispels' any negative values that they are – into ‘great values’. That is: power.

In the history of thought, the Enlightenment refers to eighteenth-century Europe, involved a period of nationalism, and socialism; likewise, Sophocles and Plato. It is followed at ‘the’ convention that Enlightenment ideas are a form of self-overcoming.

The notion of the Synthesis of an idea or concept onto another concept or actor, often done by means of a turning of the head.

There are several related concepts about. First, that what is real is unchanging, and not a case of some one- thing. This is a case of a set of stimuli or ideals being encapsulated or encapsulated in a single substance. Second, that what is real is something like a process, that creates or creates new things, then goes under. What is dreamlike is not necessarily the future, but the sense of becoming more and more is an increasing feature of waking life.

Third, that what is real is a series of interlinked processes, each taking place behind a ‘mysterious desk’. This is a case of a particular object, for example, or an ideal, being or becoming, that is not a product of some vast mechanical or cognitive apparatus. It is not a 'piece of art' that is somehow unmediated or unchanging.

Microscopically, night and day are like clouds; in verse, we get the chance to thinking of the modern as both a cloud and a city (night and day are also quiet). Similarly, dark and light is the distance between two points of the same solar system; indeed, the night sky is both a mask and a spectator. Both worlds are forms of healing, the mutually reinforcing reciprocity of sunlight and light, which is not homogeneous. Likewise, the symbol of 'nocturnal' becomes possible, too, and is a metaphor for the diversity of biological, psychological, or cultural forces that make up the human (e.g. climate change is a 'nocturnal phenomenon').

Depth has several meanings. First, depth describes the more interesting or revealing rule (i.e. those who are not among the great and noble), as opposed to the exception. Second, that which is ‘below’ the superficial, especially conventional interpretations of psychological phenomena. Third, similarly, some people or peoples are ‘profound’ as opposed to those who are only superficial. Partly because interesting and revealing, depth is often the necessary precondition or accompaniment of height and ascent.

Descartes is a seventeenth-century French philosopher. His importance is being first in the line of ‘modern’ philosophers who offer a critique of the Christian concept of soul. Similarly, Descartes’ idea that animals are biological machines is praised, as well as Descartes as a psychologist. Nevertheless, Descartes’ faith in the immediate integrity of self-reflection is a frequent target.

Desert is a common symbol that it stands for some mode of life or method of enquiry that is characterized by solitary suffering, wandering or uncertainty, and thus also temptation (a mirage or an oasis). The story of the Israelites wandering in the desert (Exodus) or the temptation of Jesus in the desert are unavoidable allusions; likewise, anthropological accounts of nomadic peoples in Arabia. For examples, the camel tests its strength in the desert, the lion becomes lord of its desert

The symbols of height and ascending play a vital role, understandably associated with for example mountains, birds, lightness (as opposed to heaviness), the sky (e.g. astronomical references), cold and overcoming. Such symbols follow rooted conventions within philosophy (Plato’s philosopher climbs up from the cave) and culture more widely (God and heaven above us, elevated moods, high priests, etc.). The symbol stands for the increase of an individual’s (our) power and health, and thus also for the increase in everyone else. For example, both an intensifier and an unifier are devoted to increasing overall health and well-being. In contrast, those symbols of life (marriage, motherhood, work, education, etc.) that are vital for a people, but an ‘opposite ideal’ is also an important symbol. Altruism sometimes intrudes itself in symbols of life, but not in values. The idea of mythic figures sculpting the image of space (e.g. Zeus and Tragedy Anna) or tragedy as metaphor is an illegitimate exercise where the magnetism of light is not revealed.

Convalescence means the course of suffering and surviving from illnesses caused by physiologies or cultures. The sickness led from cultures, in a sense, is by no means entirely metaphorical - that is ideas, beliefs, values, or modes of life that one has inherited and with which he or she is surrounded. When we talk about ‘convalescence’, it usually links to this second kind of illness, and its overcoming, in mind. Convalescence as an overcoming is thus contrasted to comforting as a relieving of suffering. Convalescence is also part of the cycle of creative states, linked to exhaustion and the need for repose.

A conviction is a belief, held stubbornly to be 'unqualified truth'. There is a notion developed by the dangers and origin of conviction that one must be a 'noble traitor' to one's convictions. Convictions are opposed by both the genius of science and justice. Therefore, those who embrace science and justice are considered as the wanderer,  a thinker who has no home or 'destination' (both understood as convictions).

Courage and bravery are an ancient virtue that we need to appreciate and revalue. Courage is the ability to stick firmly to life and the real, and not to borrow one’s beliefs and values from imaginary other worlds or modes of being. Likewise, it is courage not to manufacture one’s beliefs and values by a fearful negation of becoming, uncertainty and suffering, which are the conditions of life and the real. Such courage in the type is represented by Epictetus (the Stoic philosopher who had been a slave) and contrasts it with the Christian slave characterized by faith and hope in a different life. A few sections later, courage is proclaimed as a key ‘future virtue’: the arrogance to understand and not be afraid of the world. This courage is not dissimilar to generosity. Thus, the courageous type of thinker who is aware of the ‘cruelty of the intellectual conscience’, which does not simplify but insists upon multiplicity and perspective. Such courage is a form of self-overcoming. Zarathustra talks about those among his disciples who are too cowardly to change the direction of their willing and thus soon abandon him in favour of their contentment. Likewise, it is Zarathustra’s courage that tells the Spirit of Gravity to get off his back.

Happy because unconcerned with past or future, or not stricken by heavy thoughts (here, chewing the cud means focused in the present moment, not prone to nausea). The cow is also patient and seeing, and thus a metaphor for reading and interpretation as an art lost in modernity; rumination means to consider and contemplate without hurry. The cow is trusting, not slighted by distance or change; warm and reassuring like a faithful companion. The cow is an essential religious symbol in many Eastern religions: the ‘voluntary beggar’, learning contentment from a herd of cows, is a portrait of Jesus as a displaced and misunderstood Eastern sage. The cow’s calm is a possible and worthy response to nihilism and the degeneration of humanity.

There are two layers of meaning to the term 'creation'.  First, 'creation" signifies to the religious or theological terminology, but its use is not confined to such contexts; second, 'creation' is a slightly more 'ordinary' term about concepts, such as 'making', 'crafting' or producing'.

it' as a critical element within the analyses of psychology and religion for the interpretation of the nature of life or the nature of a life that is beyond our power or control. Such thinking links contemplation with the death of God, with the ‘convalescence of which is a reaction against something important coming within reach of its power’. In other words, death is a blow against the wish to make things ideal, and thus death is also a target.

Similarly, philosophy comprises a ‘long, petty, crass, anti-Semitic, and anti-Semitic’ playbook for attracting and keeping people. Testament to the death of God, Christianity is a product of the death of a great god. In contrast, history has been a fertile breeding ground for the development of the human, whose power and dominion over the earth make it an ideal laboratory for the development of new forms of human life. At the level of N—earth and human: the latter relies upon natural forces as metaphors.

Cheerfulness, most often, but the concept shades into other words that might otherwise be interpreted as happiness or joyfulness. Optimism cannot be a consequence of a lack of awareness of pain, cruelty or destructiveness – because this was the people that invented tragedy and celebrated the wisdom of Silenus – nor could it be a consequence of ‘unendangered ease and comfort’, or pure sensuality, because then philosophy would never have arisen. Instead, this cheerfulness or serenity arises because of the healing effects of Apollonian beauty. Because on its terms the immersion into the Dionysian is experienced as ‘the eternal lust and delight of existence’. That is to say, the Greeks were much more aware of the true nature of existence than we moderns but had developed a culture in which reality is justified as an aesthetic phenomenon. This degenerates after the death of tragedy into the ‘cheerfulness of slaves’ without responsibility.

There are three meanings in cheerfulness. First, cheerfulness as blissful ignorance; second, cheerfulness as a disguise, a way of appearing to be different from, and be misunderstood by, others. Third, and most importantly, cheerfulness is part of the ideal of a new form of life that does not suffer from the defining features of modernity. This last idea is, in part, an updating of the Apollonian concept; in part, it is a new analysis of the perils of an over-historicized culture (see historical sense). Cheerfulness is thought of as an effect of the exercise of power, or of one who shows an excess of strength. Likewise, it is a characteristic of someone who has found their proper element, the role most aligned to their character. Thus, the highest human beings of the present will be both ‘cheerful’ and ‘live dangerously’. Taking the questioning of morality seriously has, as a kind of reward, cheerfulness – or the ‘gay science’. In other words, there is a stage of nausea or nihilism in the confrontation with the genealogy of values, but this stage overcomes itself in cheerfulness. The significance of cheerfulness considers that optimism is a constant cycle with severe intellectual labour and a form of convalescence.

As a symbol, the child has two conventional meanings, either that age of humanity which is innocent or that which is most animal-like and dominated by instinct and passion. In association with this innocence, the child figure is capable of genuine creation, or more commonly, the child is synonymous with pure nature and a healthy relationship to the future. It is thus appropriate. Similarly, those who are contemplating marriage should ask themselves ‘have you the right to wish for a child’.

The notion of the ‘eternal child’  is an allusion to Ovid’s account of Jacchus (associated with Dionysus, particularly in the idea of perpetual rebirth).  The concept also has a reference to Heraclitus, who wrote that time, or the creator, is a child building with, then scattering, his playthings. Mozart was often called an ‘eternal child’. The concept of child has two-fold. First, that psychologically, there is no sharp divide between childhood and adulthood, and to believe there is shown an unhealthy devotion to seriousness. Second, that in the ‘genuine man, a child is hidden, it wants to play’  – that is, the higher human will embrace the concepts of play, toys, laughter, or fantasy. Thus, if knowledge removes its playthings, it will have to create others in a perpetual cycle.
