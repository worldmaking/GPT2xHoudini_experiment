 it is an eternal recurrence, like its philosophical meaning.

Although atheism involves a rejection of a notion of nature, in the discipline of natural law there is a significant difference. The tyrant who is ostracised; the philosopher who is falsely praised for hisvereocles; the a priori knowledge that the gods do not act but are (i.e. by chance) committed to the eternal recurrence of history.

In Christian thought, and much of European metaphysics, the ego is the figure of mortality (as opposed to the human-animal distinction that is Epicurus about which there is a distinction between instinct and instinct, both essential for human development). This is a commentary on the necessity in human affairs of class or caste; and, a claim about the will to power as a fundamental description of life. The notion of the beast of prey or the infamous image of the ‘blond beast’ belongs here. Notice in these passages that the beast of prey image is by no means always a positive one: on what and how it preys, and with what good conscience, is the difference. While culture and the state begin with the ‘blond beast’, the further development of the human type will occur through ‘bad conscience’ – a phenomenon utterly impossible for that beast.

'Ant' defers to the symbol of work, especially industrial, as part of a homogeneous group. Also, it means small, incremental and in-themselves blind contributions and likewise a necessarily limited or fragmentary view of purposes or projects.

Anthropomorphism means to impose the form or qualities of the human onto something. The innumerable ways in which the histories of science, philosophy or religion have involved anthropomorphism. A key example is the concept of cause and effect in nature that this separation of cause and effect is an anthropomorphism, founded upon what is already a false characterisation of human action in terms of will. The whole of our knowledge of the world (including human beings) is anthropomorphic.

On the one hand, then, these anthropomorphisms are illegitimate (they are ‘lies’), despite their enormous utility for human beings. On the other hand, there stays a danger of the destruction of culture through the overemphasis on critique (historicism, specialisation, etc.). The generation of greatness, the flourishing and advancement of the human depend upon such ‘lies’ being productive in the realm of culture.

Anti-Semitism is a symptom of a weak and defensive culture, of ressentiment, of nationalism and of a form of asceticism that demands stimulation.

'Antichrist, The' should be understood more as ‘Anti-Christian’ and tightly focused on the psychological and physiological meanings of the advent, growth, and triumph of Christianity, in comparison, especially with Buddhism. Notable for a sustained, speculative, and positive psychological interpretation of  Jesus,  as akin to a  Buddhist.  It revolves around the contrast between this Jesus and the Christ figure disastrously generated by the Church Fathers, especially Paul.

Ape primate as akin to the animal aspect of humans’ pre-dates Darwin; with Darwin thought arises the notion of a common evolutionary ancestor. The ape, then, is either an origin or disfigured mirror-image, of which we are ashamed. The ape is an imitator, unaware even of being an imitator, and which brings disrepute to the imitated.

Aphorisms is a brief, self-contained and striking piece of writing, usually gathered in sequences. Aphoristic writing was common in ancient literature and was employed by many authors. First, a random series of very brief sayings or epigrams, and second a series of longer pieces, each like a short study. There are a few added variations. Likewise, and regardless of the presence of an overarching theme to the series, aphorisms can speak to each other, as if they were short segments of a continuous piece of writing. 

The different rhythms of these various ways of writing and the different interpretative demands make on readers. The function of such writing as fully developed thoughts with either maximally compressed, or fragmentary, expression and an ‘immortal’ perfection of the form; aphorisms serve as a kind of test of readers; or an interpretative task set to readers, perhaps because the expression is deliberately incomplete.

 it is 'a miracle'. The free spirit and ‘seeker after knowledge’ must be able to see with many eyes, to see with many senses. Such clarity, judgement, and clarity of purpose leads to the idea of the pathos of distance, because thus far the Greeks were not scale-like, but reached to a higher nobility. This is implicitly acknowledged that the ‘complete and authentic antagonism’ is between Homer and Plato: the former the deifier of life, the latter its ‘slanderer’.

The fundamental characteristic of things as they appear to us, including ourselves and bodies, is their givenness as individual form. This is Schopenhauer’s principium individuationis and the veil of Maya. Schopenhauer, in turn, was trying to interpret Kant’s distinction between appearances and things-in-themselves and incorporate ideas from Eastern thought. ‘Behind’ appearances are the will, continually striving and becoming, without form. Here, an important distinction arises between two senses of appearance: appearance as a symbolic image in genuine art, versus appearance as mere copy, and thus as possibly deceptive. Socratic thought is the forgetting of the first possibility of occurrence,  and therefore also as the advent of a modern faith in science. This theme continues throughout his career and involves analyses of how that which merely appears is denigrated for some ‘beyond’ or ‘behind’.

Human feeling is from the ground up, a simplification of the world so that it appears as intelligible, predictable, available for human beings to use. The ultimate motive behind this is utility: without such interpretations, human beings could not survive. Moreover, different peoples interpret things according to their specific situation (e.g. climate, resources, their enemies). Thus, differences in understanding the world arise, in terms of what is valued (and what is approved or disapproved of morally).

Later, the notion of value becomes fundamental. If one rigorously rejects the hypothesis of a world, God or life that is somehow not here but ‘beyond’, then ultimately one also must rigorously refuse the notion of appearance itself. Appearance only makes sense to something ‘behind’ or ‘beyond’ it. The idea of appearance becomes transformed into the notion of perspective or interpretation. A world understood as will to power is neither something in-itself nor is its appearance but is perspectival and evaluating. The building blocks of nature and very much, including the human, are perspectives or values – in other words, relations of will to power.

In Greek mythology, Ariadne was the Cretan princess who aids the Athenian Theseus in defeating the Minotaur in the labyrinth. Ariadne was the subtlety to Theseus’ destructive power. According to some versions of the story, Theseus promises to marry her but then abandons her on Naxos. There, the God Dionysus becomes her lover. Theseus abandoning Ariadne is humanity leaving its possibilities of growth and health, in favour of the turn towards European modernity; and an abandonment of the mythic feminine in favour of a misunderstood masculine. Ariadne thus stands as a representative of the specific greatness of Greek humanity, desirous of the Dionysian. The poem, ‘Ariadne’s Lament’, portrays this desire for the Dionysian. We moderns may have more scientific knowledge, but it has not made us more exceptional beings, quite the contrary – our subtle understanding. Thus, only in giving up a narrow conception of the utility of knowledge, of progress as preservation and the alleviation of suffering, and other such ‘heroic’ modern achievements, will growth and beauty of the human be possible again.

Aristotle accounts the relation of tragedy to the chorus in ‘Greek Music Drama’; likewise, with the grand idea of the catharsis of pity and fear. Aristotle is a product of the decay of Greek culture: thus, despite his careful consideration of earlier philosophers, he has no real understanding of their greatness; likewise, Aristotle as both ‘powerful and harmless’ is exemplary of the man of science. Other themes in Aristotle include the account of time in terms of number and the notion of energeia.

Art can mean anything ‘made’, and not just the ‘fine’ arts. The category of ‘art’ covers the visual and musical arts most centrally, but also includes literature. The concept of art is also used in a broader sense, beyond its meaning as a particular cultural practice: thus, the necessary lies that are discussed in ‘On Truth and Lies’, and much later

 it is a ‘taste’, and indeed take pleasure in this self-imposed law. Likewise, higher spirits of this type will create a ‘role’ – a simplified version of themselves – as an instrument of communication or rule.

Cheerfulness, most often, but the concept shades into other words that might otherwise be interpreted as happiness or joyfulness. Optimism cannot be a consequence of a lack of awareness of pain, cruelty or destructiveness – because this was the people that invented tragedy and celebrated the wisdom of Silenus – nor could it be a consequence of ‘unendangered ease and comfort’, or pure sensuality, because then philosophy would never have arisen. Instead, this cheerfulness or serenity arises because of the healing effects of Apollonian beauty. Because on its terms the immersion into the Dionysian is experienced as ‘the eternal lust and delight of existence’. That is to say, the Greeks were much more aware of the true nature of existence than we moderns but had developed a culture in which reality is justified as an aesthetic phenomenon. This degenerates after the death of tragedy into the ‘cheerfulness of slaves’ without responsibility.

There are three meanings in cheerfulness. First, cheerfulness as blissful ignorance; second, cheerfulness as a disguise, a way of appearing to be different from, and be misunderstood by, others. Third, and most importantly, cheerfulness is part of the ideal of a new form of life that does not suffer from the defining features of modernity. This last idea is, in part, an updating of the Apollonian concept; in part, it is a new analysis of the perils of an over-historicized culture (see historical sense). Cheerfulness is thought of as an effect of the exercise of power, or of one who shows an excess of strength. Likewise, it is a characteristic of someone who has found their proper element, the role most aligned to their character. Thus, the highest human beings of the present will be both ‘cheerful’ and ‘live dangerously’. Taking the questioning of morality seriously has, as a kind of reward, cheerfulness – or the ‘gay science’. In other words, there is a stage of nausea or nihilism in the confrontation with the genealogy of values, but this stage overcomes itself in cheerfulness. The significance of cheerfulness considers that optimism is a constant cycle with severe intellectual labour and a form of convalescence.

As a symbol, the child has two conventional meanings, either that age of humanity which is innocent or that which is most animal-like and dominated by instinct and passion. In association with this innocence, the child figure is capable of genuine creation, or more commonly, the child is synonymous with pure nature and a healthy relationship to the future. It is thus appropriate. Similarly, those who are contemplating marriage should ask themselves ‘have you the right to wish for a child’.

The notion of the ‘eternal child’  is an allusion to Ovid’s account of Jacchus (associated with Dionysus, particularly in the idea of perpetual rebirth).  The concept also has a reference to Heraclitus, who wrote that time, or the creator, is a child building with, then scattering, his playthings. Mozart was often called an ‘eternal child’. The concept of child has two-fold. First, that psychologically, there is no sharp divide between childhood and adulthood, and to believe there is shown an unhealthy devotion to seriousness. Second, that in the ‘genuine man, a child is supposed to be separate from, and be misunderstood by, others. This is the ‘opposite ideal’ to the cheerful or the self-mockery.

The term of decadence with similar meanings include 'degeneration' and 'corruption'. 'Decadent' was a term of abuse used by French neo-classical or conservative critics against the romanticism of painters like Delacroix or novelists such as Hugo. Later, writers like Baudelaire adopted the term as their own, using it to express scepticism towards many dominant moral or political values. The usage of the word 'decadence' late in the late nineteenth centuries has represented the concepts of corruption, decline or degeneration date. Baudelaire is termed 'a typical decadency', and all references to him associate him with Wagner (Baudelaire was one of Wagner's champions in France). So, the meaning of 'decadence' is any period of cultural history – or any state of the human organism – which has lost its good taste and value judgement  (thus it is associated with pity; with Kantian
