 idea, it is more obvious that by pursuing such cruelty to its conclusion that an ‘opposite ideal’ can reveal itself: namely, that form of human beings who can joyously affirm his or her existence.

‘Culture’ means a form of life that people has set up for itself. This culture encapsulates their values, is what allows people both to have an identity and to reproduce and reinforce that identity over time, and which also allows people to produce excellence or greatness. The concept of culture can be used broadly, to designate types of culture that span dozens of nations and hundreds of years (e.g. ‘Alexandrian’ or ‘Hellenic’); or narrowly, to discuss individual peoples or sub-groups (such as ‘noble culture’ ). Culture includes everything from mundane practices (e.g. diet, daily routines), through institutions (church, military, education) up to ‘high’ culture (literature and art).

Culture is thought of as the variety of ways that the underlying Will has of keeping a people alive, and especially stimulating or tricking ‘nobler natures’ who feel the burden of being. There has a distinguish between an authentic and an inauthentic (or dispersed) culture, and similarly between lower and higher. Authentic culture can be defined as one that is unified, and which still serves a vital purpose of all culture, which is to produce genius or greatness. The dispersion of culture happens through the influence of the drive for knowledge, especially historical knowledge, which eventually turns culture into a mere patchwork of styles or practices borrowed randomly from the past, and without the dynamism to take on future projects. The Socratic drive for knowledge cannot be eliminated; instead, the task of culture is to incorporate it into a unity. This concern associates understanding the integration of culture and aids its development in modernity.

Furthermore, the concept of culture also becomes aligned to the conception of power but stays similar in essential respects. Higher culture comprises the feeling of power and the growth of power; indeed, higher culture always begins with barbarians, perhaps with contempt for and the destruction of a previous decadent culture, but in any case with the ‘lust for power’ and cruelty with a good conscience. Cultural advances depend upon power differences and the ‘pathos of distance’; in turn, this means that culture is a ‘pyramid’ with a broad base of workers. Contrasted to higher culture is one based on various forms of physical or spiritual narcotization or making ill (the ‘madhouses of culture’). It is this lack of a future, a lack of awareness that there could or should be future possibilities, that causes deeply disturbing.

In the beginning, Zarathustra calls himself ‘cunning’ when he refuses to reveal that he is using the honey as bait for the higher men. Such cunning, that is, has entered the philosopher’s ‘fishing tackle’ as serving his or her comprehensive responsibility for the development of humans into the future. This becomes explicit that where ‘perhaps’ cunning provides more favourable conditions than scholarship for the development of the philosopher – and again, the following section where cunning is the ‘kindness’ behind the mask. 

Cunning is also associated with the ability to find a way to preserve a diseased or decadent life. These two usages are not in contradiction but are a recognition of the amoral truth that not all battles can be fought in the open, with displays of force.

There is the idea of eternal recurrence in 'cycle'. Also, on a broad historical scale, there are repeated patterns of the formation of cultural forms of life, their corruption, the emergence of individuals and a slave revolution. In the life of the philosopher, there is a cycle of creative overflowing, followed by a period of exhaustion or convalescence; or, similarly, the investigation of dangerous and ugly topics, followed by 'running out into the sunlight'; likewise, Zarathustra repeatedly goes down and then up to his mountains. The symbols of feminine and masculine are also used as a means of exploring this idea. Finally, religious fervour is found with Folie circularize – Falter's phrase for what is now called manic depression or bipolar disorder – in its alternation of feelings of ecstatic redemption followed by severe penitence. Metaphorically, night and day, the seasons of the year, and the life cycle of organisms (the cycle of growth and reproduction, or of life and death) are employed to illustrate such cycles – along with associated mythical allusions, such as the life of Dionysus.

 idea of disinterest, though, is that it is a mode of thought that is not specific to us. For, a particular hatred of or fleeing from reality characterises early Christian (and not only Christian) thought. This hatred, in turn, branched out into the elevation of Jesus to divinity as an act of resentment against those who crucified him, the notions of guilt before God, and judgement and so forth. Other examples of hatred of reality include despising the body and all that is associated with the organisation (e.g. sexuality), plus the corresponding elevation in value of the fiction that is 'soul'. Likewise, modern science involves a flight from the actual, for it relies upon ideal fictions such as the atom (or some other version of substance), number, pure observation, and law. Reality thus requires redemption. What is this 'redeemed' reality? Not some renewed naïve metaphysical faith in exterior substance or matter, for example. It can only mean recognising (not as mere knowledge, but as an alignment) reality as the will to power and perspective.

States of mind (or reports of states of consciousness) that include an immediate evaluation of the state of its objects, such as pain, pleasure, or the emotions. Moreover, these states assign objects as causes or locations (this is painful, that makes me angry, etc.). All these words could also be translated as either 'emotion' (though few would call pleasure or pain an emotion) or more commonly 'feeling'. The feeling can seem to be a value-neutral report of a factual state. However, the feeling as always an interpretation, bringing the concept of soul in line with that of effect – that is, a sense is an evaluation of some physiological state. Feelings such as pity or pleasure are equally appropriately called affects. 

Sadness either meaning a specific state of suffering, or more generally the idea of emotion, and an even better interpretation would be 'mood'. Sadness is one of the three means of successful persuasion along with logos "reasoning and truth", and ethos "way of life or character, and more specifically wisdom and virtue". Sadness means understanding how emotions lead to judgements and actions. Sadness shows a more permanent state, one that goes with and is a chief characteristic of a way of life.

Christianity rescues effects from the idea of disinterest, but only if their object is transferred to God; affects are not primarily individual, but socially conditioned. Affects arise in part also because of basic intellectual operations such as imagination. A parallel discussion denies that the affects as ordinarily understood are a fundamental feature of organisms; this amounts to a rejection of specific psychological ideas that understand human behaviour through, for example, pain or pleasure. Instead, there is a physiological basis of the affects in assimilation, transformation, excretion, etc. Such discussions culminate in the thought experiment concerning the will to power. Will to power is a primitive world of affects. In turn, the affects play a role in perception, avoiding or selecting – this infects even neutral scientific claims or if reason in some way masters the affects, then this has been achieved by a long process of cruel discipline.

Moral judgements are a sublimated (i.e. diverted to be in some way more acceptable) way of discharging affects. A revaluation of values would have to include a reassessment of affects. Specific affects, such as a lust, for example, need to be redeemed as valuable for the overall health and growth of the human organism. Others, including those that are a product of resentment and form a sublimation of and release of jealousy, should be revalued as modes of sickness. A necessary part of such a revaluation, though, is to influence the domain of affects – and not just to change our conscious or intellectual view of things. In other words, new values change the way we feel and are incorporated into the body. The Dionysian state as a total stimulation of the affective system, transforming itself through and into all affects.  The great human who can redeem reality does so by immersion, even identification, with it.

Affirmation is a yes-saying in two senses. First, a yes-saying to life, to fate, and to all the suffering or senseless destruction they in fact do and must-have, even those 'beneath' us are necessary for the perfection of the world. This first idea of affirmation is linked to the notions of amor fate and eternal recurrence. Second, affirmation specifies a mode of life the values and actions of which are positive and

Buddhism is an ancient Asian nontheistic religion. Along with Vedanta, it had a significant influence on European thought from the late eighteenth century on, albeit accompanied by several misunderstandings. Schopenhauer finds in the accounts of dukkha (suffering) and the meaninglessness of action support for his pessimism; likewise, in Buddhism, he finds the ‘solution’ to suffering in the renunciation of will. Buddhism is to be praised for its lack of theism and pursuit of the otherworldly, and its freedom from ressentiment. On both these grounds, the historical Jesus is described as a Buddhistic. Nevertheless, it must be judged as a passive nihilistic form of life.

Buildings are represented a whole host of symbols here, involving the construction of, living in, decay or demolition of built structures. Most of these symbols are conventional and not difficult to understand.  Architecture occasionally is in a literal manner. Highlights include the concept about our diminished sense of the symbolic nature of building and architecture as will to power), and the observations about city architecture.

Butterfly is a vital image with far-reaching but not always clear implications. Broadly, the image of butterfly is in a negative, though also in a positive way. The critical meaning of the former is thoughtless living in and for the present. Butterfly is thus modern humanity with its newspapers and petty politics. There are two aspects to the positive meaning. First, the butterfly is childlike, innocent, and therefore able to relate to its world without the heaviness of values. Second, the butterfly is a standard mode of existence, lightly and laughingly affirming of its conditions and its fate. The butterfly, in this sense, is also eager for growth. The butterfly is used in this sense, but now with an emphasis on the problematic sacrifices that are the precondition of such growth. The idea of cocoon is about the Apollonian cultural drive being forced to disguise itself as mania for persuasion, but re-emerging in modernity.

Caesar is a Roman general, politician and then ‘dictator’ of Rome. To mention Caesar and Napoleon together metaphorize instances of something exceptionally free, characterised by scepticism and the throwing off faiths, a moment of beauty and genius. Caesar, the tyrant, is thus also an example of the opportunities and dangers of decadence, for the highest type is always ‘five paces from tyranny’. It is precisely that danger which is their condition of growth.

'Camel' is the first of the three 'transformations of the spirit'. Importantly, the spirit as camel is already a transformation, and not a default position of the human. The camel wishes the bear as heavy a burden as possible, to feel its strength and test that strength. The weights are those of the deliberate assumption of humility and self-mockery, confining oneself to a specialization, discovering dangerous or unpleasant truths, rejecting the pity of others, and overcoming one's overcoming (i.e. departing a cause when it is victorious). In other words, the camel is the free spirit as far as he or she recognizes these states as burdens; exhibits veneration towards the burdens, that interprets them as valuable; and, knows him or herself to be strong enough to bear them.
