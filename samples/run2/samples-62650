 emotions. To have contempt for something – that is, for one’s negative value judgement to achieve the level of a passion – is a mode of feeling power-over. It is, therefore, a primary drive. Likewise, the modern feeling that freedom is an absence of discipline. Equally importantly, the sense of power is a vital part of pity. Alternatively, self-contempt is found in empathy, as far as one projects one’s suffering onto others.

The devil has three primary meanings. First, it is common fears and traditional conceptions of evil. Second, the devil may be certain temptations, through which one might deviate from or be held down from one’s path of growth. Zarathustra’s devil is the ‘spirit of gravity’, while the sorcerers is ‘spirit of melancholy’ (gravity and melancholy are both variations on the word ‘Schwarz’ which means ‘heavy’). Third, the devil indicates the interconnection of the good and the bad, the positive and negative (i.e. the notion that opposites are not opposite). Thus, the devil is just God’s leisure every seventh day.

Although in philosophical history the notion of dialectic has other reference points than this (Kant and Hegel, particularly), the use of the term here is exclusively about Socrates (and by extension Plato).

What one habitually eats, and drinks has a relationship to one’s spiritual life – that is, on what we think and how we value. The traditional diets of various nations, the religious practice of fasting or the role of beer in German culture are ample proof. More generally, this is part of the concern with the ‘closest things’: the spiritual significance of the patterns of life that are generally associated with life, love, and virtue.

The term of decadence with similar meanings include 'degeneration' and 'corruption'. 'Decadent' was a term of abuse used by French neo-classical or conservative critics against the romanticism of painters like Delacroix or novelists such as Hugo. Later, writers like Baudelaire adopted the term as their own, using it to express scepticism towards many dominant moral or political values. The usage of the word 'decadence' late in the late nineteenth centuries has represented the concepts of corruption, decline or degeneration date. Baudelaire is termed 'a typical decadency', and all references to him associate him with Wagner (Baudelaire was one of Wagner's champions in France). So, the meaning of 'decadence' is any period of cultural history – or any state of the human organism – which has lost its good taste and value judgement  (thus it is associated with pity; with Kantian duty; with Schopenhauer's quieting of the will), health and sureness of instinct, discipline and sense of a future. It is to be associated either with the decline of old cultures or with moral revolutions.

The Kantian and Platonic-Christian metaphysical distinction between appearance and ‘true world’ is termed a ‘sign of decadence’. For all these reasons at Christianity is called a ‘monster of decadence’. Decadent cultures are exhausted cultures, and such cultures often exhibit a pathological over-sensitivity; indeed, often an inability not to respond, lacking the strength to inhibit one’s passions. Alternatively, the decadent culture can manifest itself as a craving for stimulation (for the voluptuous, the exotic, the dangerous). Importantly, this desire for stimulation is a symptom and not a cause – as those who react ascetically against such stimulation believe. Thus, decadence in the form of a culture of exhaustion that needs stimulation often precipitates a reaction, which is the ‘gathering gloom of the religious-moral pathos’.

Most of the above could serve as an account of the notion of degeneration or corruption also. If there is a distinction to be drawn from decadence, degeneration tends to have a stronger physiological emphasis, and is used more often in specific cases (e.g. the instincts of the criminal,  or the degeneration of individual philosophers), and is sometimes associated particularly with an increasing homogeneity of society (thus ‘herd animal’ ). Corruption, on the other hand, tends in the opposite direction and is associated with the spiritual (‘the corruption of reason’ ) and with the decline of the higher strata of society.

An ageing and over-comfortable society produce either a ‘variation’ into something higher, or degeneration and monstrosity. Corruption is a term

The visual representation of fat has significant cultural influence. The overemphasis on fat has a broader meaning: the fat character of the tales is only one of a broad set of illusory other worlds or modes of being. For example, fat men drive dyeshape and thus echo in that sense of 'to dry' (Exodus 20:<|endoftext|>), but the idea is that these energy is akin to a desire to revalue those who are famous for their strength or health, and this is in direct contradiction of the dominant modern belief in liberal values of equality and democracy. Thus, the fat person is a sense of powerlessness or something akin to the ‘man of intuition’, lacking the strength to apply the principles of logic to the real. According to some versions of the story, Theseus promises to marry her but then abandons her on Naxos. There, the God Dionysus becomes her lover. Theseus abandoning Ariadne is humanity leaving its possibilities of growth and health, in favour of the turn towards European modernity; and an abandonment of the mythic feminine in favour of a misunderstood masculine. Ariadne thus stands as a representative of the specific greatness of Greek humanity, desirous of the Dionysian. The poem,  one who loves the poem, is also regarded as a gift from the God Dionysus.

The bird is a symbol of rapid ascent, of something that needs and desires to be ahead of its time, to show spiritual growth. Birds must also be light, able to throw off burdens. The bird is thus in opposition to the spirit of heaviness. The flock of doves is precisely chosen because it is a conventional symbol of gentleness and peace but combined with the bird’s lightness and need for the ascent, and this is unlike a herd of sheep or cows, say. The dove image also has significant biblical echoes. 

The eagle (Adler) is the most common bird mentioned in N. The most famous use of the eagle is the symbol of a healthy and honest pride. The eagle can view things as beneath it; this is both a specific comprehensive sight which is not an abstraction and honest pride. The snake is cleverness. The combination of these animals (the eagle carrying the snake) is something rare: those who have pride do not understand themselves; those who are clever tend to be self-loathing. It seems likely that they also represent two significant mythic and cultural inputs into Europe, the eagle as the masculine Greek, the serpent as the feminine Judaic; their union is an expression of an as yet unrealised ‘wholeness’ of the human. The eagle is a bird of prey. Birds and especially the eagle, thus also stand for a kind of strength. Its happiness lies in relishing the terror of the great heights and the abyss, rather than in ignorance of that terror. Moreover, the eagle’s hunt is direct, straight down; it is thus, considered on its own, a noble ‘stupidity’. It is nourished on innocence, it both loves and hates the lamb – thus mirroring the relationship to the human, which is loved because of its yet unspoiled possibilities.

‘The Birth of Tragedy’, with its lack of scholarly apparatus, energetic and figure-laden prose, philosophical and psychological speculation, and a mixture of ancient and modern contexts, was not what the philological community expected. It has three primary purposes and correspondingly divides into three sections. First, to elaborate a theory of ancient Greek tragedy as a synthesis of two metaphysically understood cultural drives (Apollonian and Dionysian). In this way, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ solves the relationship between cheerfulness and pessimism ingeniously - how could the Greeks, with their in-depth knowledge of suffering and futility, have remained cheerful? Second, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ traces the reasons for the decline of tragedy to a third drive, the Socratic, which is also the advent of science and modernity. Third, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ seeks to understand what it would mean, and what it would take, for tragedy to be reborn in the present. The account of culture is thus revealed to be a general one, and not specific to Greece. The book is heavily influenced (although not entirely uncritically) by Schopenhauer, and especially in its third part plays homage to Wagner.

 emotions as eternal. Such courage in the type is represented by Epictetus (the Stoic philosopher who had been a slave) and contrasts it with the Christian slave characterized by faith and hope in a different life. A few sections later, courage is proclaimed as a key ‘future virtue’: the arrogance to understand and not be afraid of the world. This courage is not dissimilar to generosity. Thus, the courageous type of thinker who is aware of the ‘cruelty of the intellectual conscience’, which does not simplify but insists upon multiplicity and perspective. Such courage is a form of self-overcoming. Zarathustra talks about those among his disciples who are too cowardly to change the direction of their willing and thus soon abandon him in favour of their contentment. Likewise, it is Zarathustra’s courage that tells the Spirit of Gravity to get off his back.

Happy because unconcerned with past or future, or not stricken by heavy thoughts (here, chewing the cud means focused in the present moment, not prone to nausea). The cow is also patient and seeing, and thus a metaphor for reading and interpretation as an art lost in modernity; rumination means to consider and contemplate without hurry. The cow is trusting, not slighted by distance or change; warm and reassuring like a faithful companion. The cow is an essential religious symbol in many Eastern religions: the ‘voluntary beggar’, learning contentment from a herd of cows, is a portrait of Jesus as a displaced and misunderstood Eastern sage. The cow’s calm is a possible and worthy response to nihilism and the degeneration of humanity.

There are two layers of meaning to the phrase ‘transforming’. First, a slightly more general sense, namely, that what is gone is not specific, but law-breakers. Second, more specific, and indeed not specific, purposes, or points of view, are not what they are; instead, the transformation is a way of the reproductive drive. MySQL stands for the source of the late-nineteenth-century English language; today, it closely follows along the development of the modern language. First, a more general sense of the concept, namely, that what is and is not willing is. This first sense of the word desire is associated with Christian values and institutions. More generally, it is about the power of single-mindedness. Second, the idea of a translation, which is a way of the single point of view of ‘true world’. Thus, the account of the cave as a cave hermit crab where the master tells the truth the first sign of faith, and thus also the metaphor for reading and interpretation. The concept of another world, that is the over human, supreme culture, and creator of art. Thus, the human is a multiple of the other worlds we inhabit, a abyss without ressentiment.

There are two layers of meaning to the term 'creation'.  First, the literal meaning of creation is first expressed in moral laws and indeed, most importantly, the principles of metaphysics. Second, the concept of interpretation by using evidence first, often-overlooked texts as the basis for values. This concept of first-come, all is equal. Here, creation is not always appreciated as part of the natural order.

Chaos is a significant ancient concept. The earth is ‘formless and empty’ before God’s creation. Similar ideas are common in other accounts of nature, such as Hesiod for whom Chaos was the first primordial deity. Eighteenth and nineteenth-century anthropology discovered that this myth pattern often took the form of a struggle against Chaos, which was often represented by a serpent or dragon (e.g. Zeus’ battle with Typhon). The notion of Chaos is on its own; scientific knowledge is a destruction of human nature and descent to Chaos. One of the meanings of the ‘evil’ principle is ‘chaos’. However, the struggle against the dragon is a struggle against a fixed order, and for Chaos. Thus, one must have chaos within one still, to give birth to a dancing star. Here, Chaos is not the enemy of but the principle of creation.

Chaos is an essential character of the real, but the real has no intrinsic order. Thus, there has also no meaning, purpose, wisdom, or beauty. Some say that the real is ‘chaos’. The real character of the real is that which acts and has its meaning, and which is an effect of one’s own judgement a cause. The real character of Chaos is that which is both the cause and effect of some external cause. Thus, the human soul is a part of some external cause. Both
