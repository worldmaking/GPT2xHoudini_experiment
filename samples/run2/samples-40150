ation of the earth'. Since the earth is associated with matter, the 'atom' is also called an 'earth-residue'. That is, the atom is the last hold-out of a metaphysical belief in material substance.

Sometimes, also, 'the earth' is used as the proper country or nation of human beings, ignoring historically specific nations and peoples. Thus, the over human as the 'sense of the earth' means dominion over the whole earth. Because of its global reach, Christianity has been able to make the earth a 'madhouse' while free spirits are taking on the task of the management of the earth as a whole.

Ecce Homo is one of Nietzsche’s last works, written in 1888, but not published until 20 years later. It is an intellectual autobiography of infamous immodesty. The book falls into two parts. The first concerns are his way of living with a discussion of factors like diet and climate, and why these are important. Then, the next two sections supply a book-by-book commentary on his work, and then a summary of what he considers its most tremendous significance, namely ‘the uncovering of Christian morality’.

The literal meaning of the term 'economy' in Greek is 'household'. Economy is one of the most frequent concepts used to describe the interrelated, systematic nature of life (or, for example, the soul). It is suitable as far as both are dynamic and relational. That is, for example, an economy must involve both those who buy and sell; analogously, the system of life will have to apply both active and passive, weak and intense moments of will to power.

The term education has a broader meaning in culture and thus is also employed to express the process of cultivation. However, it is often used as equivalent to Rehang. Education, and significantly higher education, was a perennial theme. 

Following reforms in the early nineteenth century, which were primarily led by Humboldt, Prussia had one of the first ‘modern’ education systems in the world: publicly funded schools, teacher certification and further or higher education available based upon ability rather than class. Likewise, Humboldt had a significant role in the creation of the modern university, enshrining principles like academic independence, general rather than vocational education, and the close relation between teaching and research. However, such reforms were counter-productive, being founded on a Socratic notion of science in which knowledge is understood as information rather than a way of living, a way of thinking or involving genuine insight. The non-vocational system was serving a different kind of vocation: creating servants of economy and state, and merely reproducing or reinforcing the current system of values. Moreover, without a cultivated grasp of German, classical education is only ‘a leap in the dark’, and there is no possibility of a genuine or authentic culture. Education for culture is something different from knowledge for economic social or political roles.

Modern education, with its post-reform shape and the universal franchise, is an offshoot of modern ideas of equality and democracy. Education should be a privilege and not versatile, although this privilege should not be bound to the class. Universities have become increasingly compartmentalized, with narrow specialization, a lack of vision and redundant experimentation. Likewise, the historical sense pervades all education, including the teaching of language, taught as a dead object of study rather than a living practice, as ‘living through’ what one learns. In contrast, the philosopher must be self-educated after having passed through a variety of specializations, in order then to use them as instruments.

Many moral systems have a fundamental distinction between egoistic (or selfish) motives or acts and those that are altruistic. Altruism refers to an action based entirely on concern for the welfare of others. Thus, in particular moralities, it characterizes the highest of moral virtues, or indeed the basis of morality itself. Altruism is often claimed psychologically impossible. Altruism,  at best, is an ideal caused by suffering from a lack of love or care, a sacrifice of one aspect of the self for the egoism of another, to avoid a feeling of impotence, or gain a sense of power, a desire for possession, or an illusion propagated by those who see their self- interest in becoming a function of another, or of the whole. At worst, it is a destructive and decadent ideal. Indeed, altruism involves a contradiction: the moral demand for altruism for the sake of utility is, itself, not altruistic. The feeling for others, or their state, by great humans, is often misinterpreted as altruism, when in fact it is an expression of power. Altruism is the

ation for Chaos. Thus, one must have chaos within one still, to give birth to a dancing star. Here, Chaos is not the enemy of but the principle of creation.

Chaos is an essential character of the real, but the real has no intrinsic order. Thus, there has also no meaning, purpose, wisdom, or beauty. Some claims to have liberated things from their bondage under purposes. The idea is that all the various ways in which the real is supposed to have a pre-given order are anthropomorphic. Moral in character – restoring their chaos means restoring their innocence. Such an idea of the real as ‘chaos’ has a long philosophical tradition, stretching back to Heraclitus who argued that change was the only constant. The atomists (including the Epicureans) say that chaos is the natural state of things, and the formation of entities is both contingent and temporary. In both Hume and Kant, and after Schopenhauer, the order inexperience is not found but constructed (although for Kant, at least, this certainly did not entail that the thing was chaos).

By ‘character’ is meant either the ‘nature’ or ‘essence’ of something or, those patterns of behaviour that are distinctive of an individual, group, or type. Under the heading of character, there exist concepts such as customs or habits, virtues or vices, roles, and drives.  There are two critical strands here. The first is the notion of the unchangeability of character, an idea relevant to Schopenhauer. This notion metaphysically implausible because of the continual becoming of underlying drives - ‘you are always another person’. More importantly, it is also suspect in its value. The free spirit and ‘seeker after knowledge’ must be able to ‘declare himself against his previous opinion’. This does not mean conceiving of one’s character and opinions as somehow arbitrary or disorderly, nor being an ‘apostate’ of the free spirit. The other strand involves the creation of nature.  Characterization in art and especially in a drama is always superficial because it can only present an image of the inner necessity in the life of an actual human being. Therefore, people of ‘strong character’ are created through education in just this way, to be more like art than life and thus to be useful to their community. The genuinely more energetic spirit, however, will ‘give style’ to their character, force it under one ‘taste’, and indeed take pleasure in this self-imposed law. Likewise, higher spirits of this type will create a ‘role’ – a simplified version of themselves – as an instrument of communication or rule.

Cheerfulness, most often, but the concept shades into other words that might otherwise be interpreted as happiness or joyfulness. Optimism cannot be a consequence of a lack of awareness of pain, cruelty or destructiveness – because this was the people that invented tragedy and celebrated the wisdom of Silenus – nor could it be a consequence of ‘unendangered ease and comfort’, or pure sensuality, because then philosophy would never have arisen. Instead, this cheerfulness or serenity arises because of the healing effects of Apollonian beauty. Because on its terms the immersion into the Dionysian is experienced as ‘the eternal lust and delight of existence’. That is to say, the Greeks were much more aware of the true nature of existence than we moderns but had developed a culture in which reality is justified as an aesthetic phenomenon. This degenerates after the death of tragedy into the ‘cheerfulness of slaves’ without responsibility.

There are three meanings in cheerfulness. First, cheerfulness as blissful ignorance; second, cheerfulness as a disguise, a way of appearing to be different from, and be misunderstood by, others. Third, and most importantly, cheerfulness is part of the ideal of a new form of life that does not suffer from the defining features of modernity. This last idea is, in part, an updating of the Apollonian concept; in part, it is a new analysis of the perils of an over-historicized culture (see historical sense). Cheerfulness is thought of as an effect of the exercise of power, or of one who shows an excess of strength. Likewise, it is a characteristic of someone who has found their proper element, the role most aligned to their character. Thus, the highest human beings of the present will be both ‘cheerful’ and ‘live dangerously’. Taking the questioning of morality seriously has, as a kind of reward, cheerfulness – or the ‘gay science’. In other words, there is a stage of nausea or nihilism in the confrontation with

ation of a system of values by which it is to be founded. The concept of cause and effect in nature is termed a ‘sign of decadence’. This decadence, in turn, branched out into the ‘forming of a people’ to serve God alone, or in the end into a spectacle of gods and divinities overcoming. The spectacle is the ‘gathering of the humanoids’ into a people. This is another example of the descending idea of itself. The idea is generalized as the ‘creation of despising greatness’ in the first place. There is an echo in that first phrase of Dionysus where he praises the priest for having pity on the weak.

Zarathustra is the ancient Persian religious figure. The original ideas of the Republic of Genius or the Republic of Genius are irrelevant to modern audiences. There are several aspects. The first is the notion of the distinction between a rational and a rational form of life. These would be the ‘opposite ends’, the philosopher in us would be a threat of the degeneration of virtue. The last is the thought about the ego? It is an idea relevant to us in its multiple purposes and demands an overcoming. Thus, what is unacceptable to the ego is transformed into valuable habits or practices. The idea of transformation is employed also in discussing the ‘athletic discipline’.

The concept of critique also inherits some perspective from Kant. For example, it seems to be at stake in his analysis of Socrates. Socrates was incapable of turning the logical drive against itself. As a result, it is also a vital opponent today. First, critique the architecture of higher culture. 'What is important is an incomplete and wilful misunderstanding of what is and is not real, or genuine ideas'. Second, more generally, 'what is real is something like a product of the way the mindmaps' (pp. 32-33). Third, just as the physiologies must be revalued as texts, so the analysis of the function of eyes in the conceptualisation of the body. The account of the body, for example, must be understood as sets of habits or institutions that function as places where things are liberated from the bondage of a symbolic, revengeful life. The account of culture is thus a fundamental principle of science. There are two clues. First, through a notion of substance, fat has a stronger sense of place and a longer history than body, and a broader meaning than body. Second, a physical class is the subjects of a metaphor, one whose existence is an expression of physical power (i.e. ableism). Thus, the physical class is "abundance", but not substance. The concept of class is also used to characterize the represented classes.

The notion of ‘castes’ is an essential one, as are the universal human types. However, the free spirit and ‘castes’ require an absolute coexistence with other virtues. The necessary coexistence may seem to be aComing that is not an elevation’s condescending. The coexistence of various classes must include the equality of power, and not be founded upon the positing of homogeneity or equality. There must also be a social coexistence among the sexes and a reproductive one with the male sex. Thus, the coexistence of various physiologies with various others must be founded upon a necessary antagonism.  There are also some basic concepts of chemistry and philosophers. The concept of community is also used as a term of abuse. The coexistence of various physiologies with various others is founded upon the love of the past and a desire for stability and the overcoming of militarized nationalism. The coexistence of various races and cultures is founded upon the idea of the ‘incorporation’ of various classes into the modern European order.

Comprehensiveness is a concept without a single term to name it. Comprehensiveness describes an individual capable of naming the many, from theographers to philosophers. Comprehensiveness is founded upon the idea of the constant flux of data, and arises even more importantly from the notion of number ‘the thinker's understanding the solitary genius of a thinker’. Thus, comprehensiveness is a product of the development of the intellect, or the maintenance of the stability of values. It is also part of the concept of the overcoming of intellect. It is also part of the concept of the ‘iron-clad truth teller’. Comprehensiveness is the idea of the continuous becoming of itself, its own, and its environment. Thus, comprehensiveness is the thought of the becoming of some external object, such as a god, that is somehow not themselves an external reflection of itself. Thus, the comprehensiveness of a philosopher’s sight lies in ‘overthought judgement’, and again, the concept of judgement a) is
