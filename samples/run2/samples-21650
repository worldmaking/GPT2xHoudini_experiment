 wisdom. Instead, a good conscience is the ability to remain devoted to the character and the walk of the great human, the deception of discussing or discussing, illness, marriage, the over human, and the over cloud. My conscience is the conscience of the age, and the fate of my people and my ideals. My conscience is the conscience of the whole of the human, and not of just any animal. My conscience is the common herd animal, an echo of the example of humans from past lives. The representative of the herd is the ‘governing idea’ of life, or the survival of the social group as a whole,ipeging towards the goal of work or abundance. The example of overcoming one’s way of life might be to influence others, and vice versa. This sharing of a fate is a the ‘dangerous new concept of life’. That is, a new conceptNASDAQ: HEXICO’, to be sure, there are two parts. The first concerns are race and class. There are two thoughts about desecration: one concerning one’s burdens and that one’s treasure amongst others. One might even say that human beings are ‘anti-desert’.

'Antichrist, The' should be understood more as ‘Anti-Christian’ and tightly focused on the psychological and physiological meanings of the advent, growth, and triumph of Christianity, in comparison, especially with Buddhism. Notable for a sustained, speculative, and positive psychological interpretation of  Jesus,  as akin to a  Buddhist.  It revolves around the contrast between this Jesus and the Jesus we know as Devil Jesus, and the ‘spirit of God’ as the ‘spirit of man’ begin to appear.

Abyss is a murkyy and murky place, whatever the concrete conditions. The sphere of occurrence is not dominated or characterized by anything beyond a narrow domain of definition and image, but by all the broader domain of image and knowledge, and even the domain of knowledge itself. So, for example, very long periods of degeneracy and poverty are treated, under a single image, like  the ‘great cleansing’. Nor is the treatment of corruption, in which power and gain are transferred to a second group with power, and then that power is used as the basis for evil. Corruption is a crucial feature of theumes a symbolic mode of life enhancement: without the need to create.

The artistic world has no end, only means of survival. Thus, only things that are needed for life to develop. Moreover, the life of the artisan is one of the few grounds for questioning the value of modernity and other modern values, which is also the basis of human wisdom. Therefore, God is a key figure in his people's lack of wisdom, and that which is pathos againstngth.

'Antichrist, The' spectator is a typical individual or people of the present who are ‘unworthy of life’. The spectator is opinion and therefore easily dismissed. The capable spectator is the one who can experience and affirm the greatness of the last humans on the face of the earth. This exceptional stage of the human is termed the ‘orphan’ stage of cultural growth. The thinker who is incapable of’ must be a ‘cathart’, risking everything to gain the support of the masses. The calling of duty to friends and family is not possible in an ‘antiquarian’ stage.

The overcoming of one’s limitations to the only way of life on the one hand, and the protection of one’s beliefs and values by the flourishing of a modern state, drive the philosopher to seek redemption in the form of contemplation. This is as a distraction, or as a final rejection of the appearances of the mostly unreal. Moreover, it is true reminder to the lacking that they are capable of change. This is a state of the mind, entirely without regrets, without productive differences. The one with a long and unbroken will can still bestow greatness on those who can bear it.

‘Culture’ means a form of life that people has set up for itself. This culture encapsulates their values, is what allows people both to have an identity and to reproduce and reinforce that identity over time, and which also allows people to produce excellence or greatness. The concept of culture can be used broadly, to designate types of culture that span dozens of nations and hundreds of years (e.g. ‘Alexandrian’ or ‘Hellenic’); or narrowly, to discuss individual peoples or sub-groups (such as ‘noble culture’ ). Culture includes everything from mundane practices (e.g. diet, daily routines

 wisdom on the part of the ascetic priest is in direct contradiction of the philosophical emphasis placed on the protective role that the priest takes in the ascetic care of sick people. The priest is a kind of ‘doctor’ to the sick, serving to change the direction of their suffering resplendent in cheerfulness and cheerfulness-ness. The priestly ideal is also kind of catharsis’ – ‘what do I matter? What does matter?’. Epicureanism in fact is the first kind of historical evidence for the idea of Greek civilisation as strong and free towards individual greatness, or as Sparta invaded Greece and found greatness in the excess of experienced weakness and degeneration.

Aristotle accounts the relation of tragedy to the chorus in ‘Greek Music Drama’; likewise, with the grand idea of the catharsis of pity and fear. Aristotle is a product of the decay of Greek culture: thus, despite his careful consideration of earlier philosophers, he has no real understanding of their greatness; likewise, Aristotle as both ‘powerful and harmless’ is exemplary of the man of science. Other themes in Aristotle include the account of time in terms of number and the notion of energeia.

Art can mean anything ‘made’, and not just the ‘fine’ arts. The category of ‘art’ covers the visual and musical arts most centrally, but also includes literature. The concept of art is also used in a broader sense, beyond its meaning as a particular cultural practice: thus, the necessary lies that are discussed in ‘On Truth and Lies’, and much later life’s healing instinct, are both termed ‘artistic’.

True art is both token and saviour of authentically unified culture – by way of discovery and employment of the myths that unify a people. Art is also the destination of post-Enlightenment critical science. In the first phase, everything revolves around tragedy, that art is the pinnacle of ancient Greek culture, as a mechanism for achieving insight into psychological and metaphysical realities and sees as the means of rehabilitation of modernity. Analyses of other genres, such as lyric poetry, epic, or modern opera, are all treated as contributing to the understanding of tragedy. Likewise, if art in modernity deviates from the Greek conception, it serves only as a narcotic, at best a temporary relief from the fragmentation of culture and art forms. This duality of real (Greek or tragic) art – and the broader culture that goes with it – and degenerate, modern art, is a central theme.

In the second phase, we find a sceptical or even damning view taken. The age of art is over, once and for all—art and science in a different opposition and order of priority.  Art is not a route to insight or knowledge, and indeed depends upon a certain ignorance or positing of metaphysical falsehoods. The notion that art protects or soothes stays, but this is not understood as culturally productive; instead, it is a dangerous narcotic.  The development in the modernity of symbolic and de-sensualised media affects both art and its audiences. One reason for the decline of art is the thinking of the artist as the individual and the genius, rather than as essentially an artisan and in the contest with others.

One must be the poet of oneself – to live as a work of art. Art allows us to treat ourselves as phenomena, not taking ourselves and our truths too seriously. In general, art is a mode of the growth of will to power, instinctive and involuntary, associated with overfullness and perfection, and pregnancy. Art is the transformation of one’s environment into an image of one’s beautiful creation – it is a mirage and not the real thing. An ‘art of life’ is a crucial characteristic of great peoples, too; similarly, while talks about art without artists, by which means certain kinds of institutions (the idea is similar to how culture drives work through individuals).

The symbols of height and ascending play a vital role, understandably associated with for example mountains, birds, lightness (as opposed to heaviness), the sky (e.g. astronomical references), cold and overcoming. Such symbols follow rooted conventions within philosophy (Plato’s philosopher climbs up from the cave) and culture more widely (God and heaven above us, elevated moods, high priests, etc.). The symbol stands for the increase of an individual’s (or a people’s) power and health, and thus also for the increase in their capacity for beauty, great projects, or rule. For example, both an anarchy of the instincts and a need to fight the instincts, are symptoms of decadence, explaining that for ascending life, happiness

Ape primate as akin to the animal aspect of humans’ pre-dates Darwin; with Darwin thought arises the notion of a common evolutionary ancestor. The ape, then, is either an origin or disfigured mirror-image, of which we are ashamed. The ape is an imitator, unaware even of being an imitator, and which brings disrepute to the imitated.

Aphorisms is a brief, self-contained and striking piece of writing, usually gathered in sequences. Aphoristic writing was common in ancient literature and was employed by many authors. First, a random series of very brief sayings or epigrams, and second a series of longer pieces, each like a short study. There are a few added variations. Likewise, and regardless of the presence of an overarching theme to the series, aphorisms can speak to each other, as if they were short segments of a continuous piece of writing. 

The different rhythms of these various ways of writing and the different interpretative demands make on readers. The function of such writing as fully developed thoughts with either maximally compressed, or fragmentary, expression and an ‘immortal’ perfection of the form; aphorisms serve as a kind of test of readers; or an interpretative task set to readers, perhaps because the expression is deliberately incomplete.

Apollonian is named after the Greek God Apollo; this is one of three drives that it is a key to understanding cultural production and cultural change, from the ancient  Greek world on. The other two are Dionysian and Socratic. A  brief period in which the Apollonian and Dionysian work together produces ancient tragedy. The Apollonian is the origin of those cultural forms where beauty and clarity of form are emphasised (examples would be epic poetry, architecture, and sculpture), and the effects of calm or cheerfulness. Apollonian implicitly carries with it a metaphysical view concerning reality, that is, the belief that individual entities are ontologically original. Importantly, though, the Apollonian is also characterised by an awareness that these valued forms are an illusion to a Dionysian view of existence (a dream in which we are aware we are dreaming). Thus, the Apollonian should not be understood as a kind of self-deception or turning away from the real (that would be more akin to the Socratic). In his later work, the Apollonian is no longer thought of as a competing, brother drive to the Dionysian, but as a moment (of calm, stillness, beauty, image, etc.) within the latter. This is implicitly acknowledged that the ‘complete and authentic antagonism’ is between Homer and Plato: the former the deifier of life, the latter its ‘slanderer’.

The fundamental characteristic of things as they appear to us, including ourselves and bodies, is their givenness as individual form. This is Schopenhauer’s principium individuationis and the veil of Maya. Schopenhauer, in turn, was trying to interpret Kant’s distinction between appearances and things-in-themselves and incorporate ideas from Eastern thought. ‘Behind’ appearances are the will, continually striving and becoming, without form. Here, an important distinction arises between two senses of appearance: appearance as a symbolic image in genuine art, versus appearance as mere copy, and thus as possibly deceptive. Socratic thought is the forgetting of the first possibility of occurrence,  and therefore also as the advent of a modern faith in science. This theme continues throughout his career and involves analyses of how that which merely appears is denigrated for some ‘beyond’ or ‘behind’.

Human feeling is from the ground up, a simplification of the world so that it appears as intelligible, predictable, available for human beings to use. The ultimate motive behind this is utility: without such interpretations, human beings could not survive. Moreover, different peoples interpret things according to their specific situation (e.g. climate, resources, their enemies). Thus, differences in understanding the world arise, in terms of what is valued (and what is approved or disapproved of morally).
