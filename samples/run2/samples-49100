 conditional values means to understand or apply what is rejected as acceptable. Moreover, for the first stressor of faith in the absence of a transcendent or impossible object, then the affirmation of the self can be true even. At the level of insight at least, there is a period of cultural paralysis where the rejection of reality is not felt as an absolute necessity, but as a virtue. Here is a historical sense with aic possibilities: not only is Christianity a total disaster to the concept of eternal recurrence, but also to the notion of eternal recurrence as expressed in the New Testament. Christianity is a total disaster to the concept of eternal recurrence, and also to the notion of chance in the first place. In such a case, the ‘great despising’ of the human is not worth the risk. Moreover, the despising is not just renunciation, but gratitude and the rejection of life. The idea of gratitude is that which breaks the unity of society, to some extent, because of genetic or social means. Also, the idea is that whichctory gratitude for having built aiful and devoted life.hemently insists on life trying to find its proper element, and trying both in the life of still further variations. The toughest of work now is to consider what it would take to make existence genuinely possible. The person of science or who can say with certain certainty ‘no’life’ to life.ll.

Moral judgements are a sublimated (i.e. diverted to be in some way more acceptable) way of discharging affects. A revaluation of values would have to include a reassessment of affects. Specific affects, such as a lust, for example, need to be redeemed as valuable for the overall health and growth of the human organism. Others, including those that are a product of resentment and form a sublimation of and release of jealousy, should be revalued as modes of sickness. A necessary part of such a revaluation, though, is to influence the domain of affects – and not just to change our conscious or intellectual view of things. In other words, new values change the way we feel and are incorporated into the body. The Dionysian state as a total stimulation of the affective system, transforming itself through and into all affects.  The great human who can redeem reality does so by immersion, even identification, with it.

Affirmation is a yes-saying in two senses. First, a yes-saying to life, to fate, and to all the suffering or senseless destruction they in fact do and must-have, even those 'beneath' us are necessary for the perfection of the world. This first idea of affirmation is linked to the notions of amor fate and eternal recurrence. Second, affirmation specifies a mode of life the values and actions of which are positive and healthy expressions of that life. That is, values and actions are not derived by or reaction against or even sublimation of other values. These two senses are closely related; indeed, they both describe aspects of an ascending and healthy mode of life. The first concerns the embracing of the whole system of life and one’s responsibility for one’s fate. The second relates only to ideas of cleanliness or perpetual rebirth.

States of mind (or reports of states of consciousness) that include an immediate evaluation of the state of its objects, such as pain, pleasure, or the emotions. Moreover, these states assign objects as causes or locations (this is painful, that makes me angry, etc.). All these words could also be translated as either 'emotion' (though few would call pleasure or pain an emotion) or more commonly 'feeling'. The feeling can seem to be a value-neutral report of a factual state. However, the feeling as always an interpretation, bringing the concept of soul in line with that of effect – that is, a sense is an evaluation of some physiological state. Feelings such as pity or pleasure are equally appropriately called affects. 

Sadness either meaning a specific state of suffering, or more generally the idea of emotion, and an even better interpretation would be 'mood'. Sadness is one of the three means of successful persuasion along with logos "reasoning and truth", and ethos "way of life or character, and more specifically wisdom and virtue". Sadness means understanding how emotions lead to judgements and actions. Sadness shows a more permanent state, one that goes with and is a chief characteristic of a way of life.

Christianity rescues effects from the idea of disinterest, but only if their object is transferred

 conditional or protective' habit. Finally, the animal kingdom is one where differences (such as those along the food chain) are an integral part of a healthy system. This is a commentary on the necessity in human affairs of class or caste; and, a claim about the will to power as a fundamental description of life. The notion of the beast of prey or the infamous image of the ‘blond beast’ belongs here. Notice that the beast of prey image is by no means always a positive one: on what and how it preys, and with what good conscience, is the difference. While culture and the state begin with the ‘blond beast’, the further development of the human type will occur through ‘bad conscience’ – a phenomenon utterly impossible for that beast.

Anthropomorphism means to impose the form or qualities of the human onto something. The innumerable ways in which the histories of science, philosophy or religion have involved anthropomorphism. A key example is the concept of cause and effect in nature that this separation of cause and effect is an anthropomorphism, founded upon what is already a false characterisation of human action in terms of will. The whole of our knowledge of the world (including human beings) is anthropomorphic.

On the one hand, then, these anthropomorphisms are illegitimate (they are ‘lies’), despite their enormous utility for human beings. On the other hand, there stays a danger of the destruction of culture through the overemphasis on critique (historicism, specialisation, etc.). The generation of greatness, the flourishing and advancement of the human depend upon such ‘lies’ being productive in the realm of culture.

'Antichrist, The' should be understood more as ‘Anti-Christian’ and tightly focused on the psychological and physiological meanings of the advent, growth, and triumph of Christianity, in comparison, especially with Buddhism.

It revolves around the contrast between this Jesus and the Christ figure disastrously generated by the Church Fathers, especially Paul.

The ape, then, is either an origin or disfigured mirror-image, of which we are ashamed. The ape is an imitator, unaware even of being an imitator, and which brings disrepute to the imitated.

Aphorisms is a brief, self-contained and striking piece of writing, usually gathered in sequences. Aphoristic writing was common in ancient literature and was employed by many authors. First, a random series of very brief sayings or epigrams, and second a series of longer pieces, each like a short study. There are a few added variations. Likewise, and regardless of the presence of an overarching theme to the series, aphorisms can speak to each other, as if they were short segments of a continuous piece of writing. 

The different rhythms of these various ways of writing and the different interpretative demands make on readers. The function of such writing as fully developed thoughts with either maximally compressed, or fragmentary, expression and an ‘immortal’ perfection of the form; aphorisms serve as a kind of test of readers; or an interpretative task set to readers, perhaps because the expression is deliberately incomplete.

Apollonian is named after the Greek God Apollo; this is one of three drives that it is a key to understanding cultural production and cultural change, from the ancient  Greek world on. The other two are Dionysian and Socratic. A  brief period in which the Apollonian and Dionysian work together produces ancient tragedy. The Apollonian is the origin of those cultural forms where beauty and clarity of form are emphasised (examples would be epic poetry, architecture, and sculpture), and the effects of calm or cheerfulness. Apollonian implicitly carries with it a metaphysical view concerning reality, that is, the belief that individual entities are ontologically original. Importantly, though, the Apoll

 conditional. In all these cases, a cause is posited that lies outside the natural order.

The third strand of thought concerning causality is the notion of sublimation, in which a force or desire has its ‘direction’ changed – that is, its mode of discharge – by a second force or passion. There, the distinction between a vast quantum of power, and a smaller trigger, serves to give the former direction. The latter would be the ends we set ourselves for tasks or our lives. But these are often ‘unconscious’ forces, and they often function as controls or at least are not initially irrelevant. The mobility and power of drives is a crucial feature of terms such as ‘power or will’. Finally, the issue of destination, power or will – and the offenders – is much more common then will to the death of one’s dreams.

Certain kinds of growth or creativity only take place under strict rules or harsh conditions. Where creativity is an overcoming, creativity needs opposition (agon). If external resistance is not to be found – a rival or enemy, a precarious situation – one must impose such resistances upon oneself, likewise, in modern music after Wagner. A related notion is that of the discipline involved in the method, such as the ‘discipline of spirit’; likewise, the ‘rigorous self-discipline’ and thus ‘liberation’; or the discipline of logic that is akin to dance. The connection made just there between logic and dance suggests that discipline fails unless directed first and foremost at the body; it must be a training at the level of physiology if it is to have any effect. Discipline in this sense of rigorous training is the meaning of the Greek term askesis. ‘Discipline’ also describes the task of those comprehensive ‘new philosophers’ to redeem the creation of human greatness from the ‘nonsense and accident’ of history.

The word discipline is the same as that which is translated ‘breeding’ – and indeed, the concepts are related since, in both, there is a deliberate choice and harsh pruning. Likewise, the idea of education is often discussed in this connection.  At the same time, discipline without the accompaniment of nobility or good taste can be a disaster. Accordingly, discipline as the turning of one’s cruel instincts onto oneself is a crucial aspect of the description of the origin of ‘bad conscience’.

'Distance' appoints the separation or independence of things. Zarathustra is still 'distant' from the people in the marketplace, for they do not understand him; again, if he has pity, then it is 'from a distance' so as not to humiliate the pitied. An associated idea is that distance characterizes a longing for ideas that lie beyond the currently existing forms of the human (e.g. 'Too long have I. Investigated the distance'). In a manner akin to Buddhism, Jesus refuses to place happiness or the ideal at a distance – that is in a transcendent deity or an unfulfillable promise. 

The most famous usage of the metaphor of distance is in the expression 'pathos of distance.' Indeed, a distinction is implied between 'distant' and the more general Ferne, employing the former when he wants to draw attention primarily to 'rank'. The relevant sense of distance is that of insisting upon real distinctions among individuals or groups (mainly between types or classes), and the value of these for the health and growth of human life (it is thus related to height or 'separation'). Even among his or her peers, even in acts of obedience, the noble person stays independent, not forming part of a 'herd'.  This distance is not just a state, but a 'pathos' – that is, a kind of effect. The effect is a state of mind that includes an evaluation of its object and leads to judgement or action. Pathos falls under this category but is not something that could be called incidental or fleeting; by 'pathos.' An effect is meant that is a defining characteristic of a way of life. The pathos of distance, therefore, stands for a defining characteristic of the noble, part and parcel of his or her self-respect and sense of right. Likewise, some things should be apprehended only from a distance, because then their image can inspire. However, such a pathos against, primarily, Christianity, which abolishes distances (except for the absurd distance of transcendence), making everyone equal, cutting any possibility of reverence among humans. Besides, the pathos of distance is significant because it represents a condition of health in the human which in turn makes a 'more mysterious pathos', namely for new possibilities of human life and growth. Likewise, those noble types who feel the pathos of distance have overall responsibility for
