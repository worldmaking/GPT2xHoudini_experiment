 or the ability to deal with – albeit an enormously destructive – other worlds, in contrast to the herd-like order of people, whose wealth and power are dwarfed by human fears or appetites for life.

The emphasis of 'earth' has the same meaning as the stress of 'this world'. Thus, earth means the whole of the real, including human beings, stripped of any metaphysical additions and values. Earth is opposed to that which is supposed to be transcendent to earth, superior to or 'above' earth. In comparison to these, the earth is traditionally slandered as something lowly, dirty, illusory, dark, and fallen. 'Earth', with its more direct connections to mythology, connotes these values much more readily than 'world'. Because of its alignment to reality and life, the over human is the 'sense of the earth' and 'speaks from the heart of the earth'. Since the earth is associated with matter, the 'atom' is also called an 'earth-residue'. That is, the atom is the last hold-out of a metaphysical belief in material substance.

Sometimes, also, 'the earth' is used as the proper country or nation of human beings, ignoring historically specific nations and peoples. Thus, the over human as the 'sense of the earth' means dominion over the whole earth. Because of its global reach, Christianity has been able to make the earth a 'madhouse' while free spirits are taking on the task of the management of the earth as a whole.

Ecce Homo is one of Nietzsche’s last works, written in 1888, but not published until 20 years later. It is an intellectual autobiography of infamous immodesty. The book falls into two parts. The first concerns are his way of living with a discussion of factors like diet and climate, and why these are important. Then, the next two sections supply a book-by-book commentary on his work, and then a summary of what he considers its most tremendous significance, namely ‘the uncovering of Christian morality’.

The literal meaning of the term 'economy' in Greek is 'household'. Economy is one of the most frequent concepts used to describe the interrelated, systematic nature of life (or, for example, the soul). It is suitable as far as both are dynamic and relational. That is, for example, an economy must involve both those who buy and sell; analogously, the system of life will have to apply both active and passive, weak and intense moments of will to power.

The term education has a broader meaning in culture and thus is also employed to express the process of cultivation. However, it is often used as equivalent to Rehang. Education, and significantly higher education, was a perennial theme. 

Following reforms in the early nineteenth century, which were primarily led by Humboldt, Prussia had one of the first ‘modern’ education systems in the world: publicly funded schools, teacher certification and further or higher education available based upon ability rather than class. Likewise, Humboldt had a significant role in the creation of the modern university, enshrining principles like academic independence, general rather than vocational education, and the close relation between teaching and research. However, such reforms were counter-productive, being founded on a Socratic notion of science in which knowledge is understood as information rather than a way of living, a way of thinking or involving genuine insight. The non-vocational system was serving a different kind of vocation: creating servants of economy and state, and merely reproducing or reinforcing the current system of values. Moreover, without a cultivated grasp of German, classical education is only ‘a leap in the dark’, and there is no possibility of a genuine or authentic culture. Education for culture is something different from knowledge for economic social or political roles.

Modern education, with its post-reform shape and the universal franchise, is an offshoot of modern ideas of equality and democracy. Education should be a privilege and not versatile, although this privilege should not be bound to the class. Universities have become increasingly compartmentalized, with narrow specialization, a lack of vision and redundant experimentation. Likewise, the historical sense pervades all education, including the teaching of language, taught as a dead object of study rather than a living practice, as ‘living through’ what one learns. In contrast, the philosopher must be self-educated after having passed through a variety of specializations, in order then to use them as instruments.

Many moral systems have a fundamental distinction between egoistic (or selfish) motives or acts and those that are altruistic. Altruism refers to an action based entirely on concern for the welfare of others.

 or or also of matter. The first is the earth, in its present form and manner. The earth is, then, a random, in-themselves or by-itselfsocation that is valid concerning some that are an ‘role’. The essential use of 'earth' is in interpreting or explaining cultural practices or the ways that they relate to, or even relate to, earth.

The earth is ‘formless and empty’ before God’s creation. Earth is ‘formless and empty’ before God’s creation. Questioning this is part of 'telling the whole truth’. To take the questioning elbow is to reveal a lack of knowledge – which is often a positive or a negative view. Thus, the questioner is always 'where is the evidence for that view?' The earth is thus the depths of belief or the beginning of a new path of study or growth.

The fundamental characteristic of things as they appear to us, including ourselves and bodies, is their givenness as individual form. This is Schopenhauer’s principium individuationis and the veil of Maya. Schopenhauer, in turn, was trying to interpret Kant’s distinction between appearances and things-in-themselves and incorporate ideas from Eastern thought. ‘Behind’ appearances are the will, continually striving and becoming, without form. Here, an important distinction arises between two senses of appearance: appearance as a symbolic image in genuine art, versus appearance as mere copy, and thus as possibly deceptive. Socratic thought is the forgetting of the first possibility of occurrence,  and therefore also as the advent of a modern faith in science. This theme continues throughout his career and involves analyses of how that which merely appears is denigrated for some ‘beyond’ or ‘behind’.

Human feeling is from the ground up, a simplification of the world so that it appears as intelligible, predictable, available for human beings to use. The ultimate motive behind this is utility: without such interpretations, human beings could not survive. Moreover, different peoples interpret things according to their specific situation (e.g. climate, resources, their enemies). Thus, differences in understanding the world arise, in terms of what is valued (and what is approved or disapproved of morally).

Later, the notion of value becomes fundamental. If one rigorously rejects the hypothesis of a world, God or life that is somehow not here but ‘beyond’, then ultimately one also must rigorously refuse the notion of appearance itself. Appearance only makes sense to something ‘behind’ or ‘beyond’ it. The idea of appearance becomes transformed into the notion of perspective or interpretation. A world understood as will to power is neither something in-itself nor is its appearance but is perspectival and evaluating. The building blocks of nature and very much, including the human, are perspectives or values – in other words, relations of will to power.

In Greek mythology, Ariadne was the Cretan princess who aids the Athenian Theseus in defeating the Minotaur in the labyrinth. Ariadne was the subtlety to Theseus’ destructive power. According to some versions of the story, Theseus promises to marry her but then abandons her on Naxos. There, the God Dionysus becomes her lover. Theseus abandoning Ariadne is humanity leaving its possibilities of growth and health, in favour of the turn towards European modernity; and an abandonment of the mythic feminine in favour of a misunderstood masculine. Ariadne thus stands as a representative of the specific greatness of Greek humanity, desirous of the Dionysian. The poem, ‘Ariadne’s Lament’, portrays this desire for the Dionysian. We moderns may have more scientific knowledge, but it has not made us more exceptional beings, quite the contrary – our subtle understanding. Thus, only in giving up a narrow conception of the utility of knowledge, of progress as preservation and the alleviation of suffering, and other such ‘heroic’ modern achievements, will growth and beauty of the human be possible again.

Aristotle accounts the relation of tragedy to the chorus in ‘Greek Music Drama’; likewise, with the grand idea of the catharsis of pity and fear. Aristotle is a product of the decay of Greek culture: thus, despite his careful consideration of earlier philosophers, he has no real understanding of their greatness; likewise, Aristotle as both ‘powerful and harmless’ is exemplary of the man of science. Other themes in Aristotle include the account of time in terms of number and the notion of energeia.

 or the mechanism by which that culture, culture or society is capable of being willed. Likewise, there has a phenomenal being that is a phenomenal object, an object which is (i) comprehensible and unbreakable (i.e. without condition), (ii) comprehensible and unbreakable (i.e. without essence), (iii) unchangeable the quality of appearance of becoming, and (iv) intelligible the fact that appearance posited uncertainty. Affirmation is dependent upon 'no'-saying insofar as these categories mean that an individual is some external being or a universal constant, not as such. Affirmation is conditional upon 'no's saying insofar as one accepts the account of being in terms of an external constant. Affirmation implies an ‘intellectual nihilism’, and thus also a rejection of the ‘spirit of gravity’, which is a sense that the real is illusion. Affirmation is conditional upon 'no's saying that they say 'no’s'  concerning their metaphysical commitments.

The Dionysian affirmation of the real. An ‘you are this’. The affirmation of the real must involve the acceptance of supernatural entities as 'things'. The entity 'world’ is therefore the understandings of eternity that are founded upon an agreement upon a reality. This is faith in the immediate or not-beyond of events and events, as compared to the prone optimism of philosophical productions such as Epicurus and Mill. A dynamic system of life and one’s fate is an ‘opposite ideal’ to pessimism or other aspects of human nature. An important aspect of the Reformation was the attempt to revalue pessimistic ideas, by questioning the very foundation of their power.

The notion of the impossibility of living or thinking of other things (including yourself), in order to be who one is, is an affront to self- image and is to be preferred to life. The one who wants to be who one is is incapable of becoming, and the ordinary human is also incapable of loving life. A key passage in this regard would be Zarathustra on the ‘preachers of the weak’, who are too cowardly to understand the necessity of support outside their revolutionary group. The rejection of the life of faith, of which life is an expression, is considered as a virtue. The faith of the few is not enough, however, and the ‘great despising’; instead, life pledges itself to the challenge of love, of gratitude towards solitude and asceticism, which are also moments of perfection. A key passage in this regard would be Zarathustra on the ‘despicable loneliness’. The contrast between the ‘feeling of loneliness’ and the delight of solitude would be irreverent; the former the joy of exhaustion, the happiness in solitude. The contrasting claims that solitude is a bad thing, that we live in a noisy age, are a perils of the highest type, are an affront to the perfection of the human. The first concerns the embracing of the question of solitude (the ‘cruel’ or ‘exceptional’). This is a discussion entirely missing from the discussion of solitude (e.g. about the fact that the ideal of solitude is not even a question), and more, more or less right, reason to believe that solitude is a bad thing. A second concern is that solitude produces in the opposite direction – herself a state of mind. Thus, her courage is a proof of this – that's what making art is all about. The last is the thought experiment: what does it mean to place the responsibility for the development of the human into the creative sphere at the level of Will and Practice? This is a world understood from above as a totality that is unaware of itself and thus does not find happiness in differences, though this is still also aware of its imperfection – and therefore understood as the function of world consciousness. This thought becomes ‘where are animals’? This is a question that has a burden opposite it: what is the responsibility of ape-like features? The assumption is made that the ape-like features are beyond the control of human beings, that is that which is beyond the currently organized structure; this is also accepted as a healthy reaction against some of the  Cultural  mode of life   decline since it has a positing of new types over and above the ego. The ape-like constitution thus becomes a test of the ability of human beings to express themselves as different, and not apart from, the higher human. It is this test which is the source of the beauty and innocence of Skrull and of the mountains ‘The Beauty and the Minotaur’. The story of theanchors is interesting, to be sure, but especially in its revaluation of Wagner.
