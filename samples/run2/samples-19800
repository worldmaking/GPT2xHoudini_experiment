 history of the body contrasts favouring comparisons to the West (except for the weights) and exceptionally well beyond. Here, the metaphor applies not a strict description of the dynamic between equals; instead, the dynamic is between representations of the body and thoughts that the representation is carrying. Thus, much more generally say, 'This is my body; this is what I convey to my readers'. All these expressions and some images were often made to symbolize power. If gods are to be celebrated, they are to represent the powerful and relatively unchanging, and not the exception.

Anthropomorphism means to impose the form or qualities of the human onto something. The innumerable ways in which the histories of science, philosophy or religion have involved anthropomorphism. A key example is the concept of cause and effect in nature that this separation of cause and effect is an anthropomorphism, founded upon what is already a false characterisation of human action in terms of will. The whole of our knowledge of the world (including human beings) is anthropomorphic.

On the one hand, then, these anthropomorphisms are illegitimate (they are ‘lies’), despite their enormous utility for human beings. On the other hand, there stays a danger of the destruction of culture through the overemphasis on critique (historicism, specialisation, etc.). The generation of greatness, the flourishing and advancement of the human depend upon such ‘lies’ being productive in the realm of culture.

'Antichrist, The' should be understood more as ‘Anti-Christian’ and tightly focused on the psychological and physiological meanings of the advent, growth, and triumph of Christianity, in comparison, especially with Buddhism. Notable for a sustained, speculative, and positive psychological interpretation of  Jesus,  as akin to a  Buddhist.  It revolves around the contrast between this Jesus and the Christ figure disastrously generated by the Church Fathers, especially Paul.

Ape primate as akin to the animal aspect of humans’ pre-dates Darwin; with Darwin thought arises the notion of a common evolutionary ancestor. The ape, then, is either an origin or disfigured mirror-image, of which we are ashamed. The ape is an imitator, unaware even of being an imitator, and which brings disrepute to the imitated.

Aphorisms is a brief, self-contained and striking piece of writing, first published in 1888, and then in full effect in 1888. Aphoristic writing was common in ancient literature and was employed by many authors. First, a random series of very brief sayings or epigrams, and second a series of longer pieces, each like a short study. There are a few added variations. Likewise, and regardless of the presence of an overarching theme to the series, aphorisms can speak to each other, as if they were short segments of a continuous piece of writing. 

The different rhythms of these various ways of writing and the different interpretative demands make on readers. The function of such writing as fully developed thoughts with either maximally compressed, or fragmentary, expression and an ‘immortal’ perfection of the form; aphorisms serve as a kind of test of readers; or an interpretative task set to readers, perhaps because the expression is deliberately incomplete.

Apollonian is named after the Greek God Apollo; this is one of three drives that it is a key to understanding cultural production and cultural change, from the ancient  Greek world on. The other two are Dionysian and Socratic. A  brief period in which the Apollonian and Dionysian work together produces ancient tragedy. The Apollonian is the origin of those cultural forms where beauty and clarity of form are emphasised (examples would be epic poetry, architecture, and sculpture), and the effects of calm or cheerfulness. Apollonian implicitly carries with it a metaphysical view concerning reality, that is, the belief that individual entities are ontologically original. Importantly, though, the Apollonian is also characterised by an awareness that these valued forms are an illusion to a Dionysian view of existence (a dream in which we are aware we are dreaming). Thus, the Apollonian should not be understood as a kind of self-deception or turning away from the real (that would be more akin to the Socratic). In his later work, the Apollonian is no longer thought of as a competing, brother drive to the Dionysian, but as a moment (of

 history. Thus, even necessity has value for the culture of the future, when its legitimacy will be able to claim for itself the concept of the mere fact of existence. This claim is made throughout the book concerning the validity of peoples' (i.e. gentleness or gentlenessd) and historical periods (history is a record of times, but the events themselves are imitated).

The closest things can be considered with "good neighbours'. While the philosophical tradition tends to chase after the prominent and most distant questions of existence, and particularly of other transcendent or ideal presences, we should pay attention to this world and life. Because of continuous becoming, not only are these big questions hopelessly unsolvable, but even the ways of life typical of only a few generations earlier may be old-fashioned. Therefore, philosophy needs to refocus on issues of health, mode of life, the small-scale sociology of friendships, the family and other interpersonal relations, the role of architecture, educational institutions, etc. These conditions must eventually have an impact upon a thought, and upon the ability of thought to be critical or creative with respect to values. This list very much includes the everyday things around us: for example, our daily habits, our diet, and where (e.g. climate, city, town, or country) and in what we live.

The cloud has no symbolic meaning. If the Dionysian has reappeared in modernity, then the Greek sense of the Apollonian must also have appeared. The Apollonian was thus both an enormous challenge and a fortunate exception. The ascent of the human is shown by way of lowerliness to so-called ‘immaculate’ forms, by trying to imitate their feeling of power (by withdrawing specific desires from others). All that is needed now is a ‘rational’ or ‘free’ person, attempting to imitate and surpass their former self. The highest form of life, then, is the one that has the strength to remain still and still, and that is the levelizer. If this is the case, then the ascetic ideal is a model of living life, working for the sake of one’s eternal soul.

The emphasis of 'earth' has the same meaning as the stress of 'this world'. Thus, earth means the whole of the real, including human beings, stripped of any metaphysical additions and values. Earth is opposed to that which is supposed to be transcendent to earth, superior to or 'above' earth. In comparison to these, the earth is traditionally slandered as something lowly, dirty, illusory, dark, and fallen. 'Earth', with its more direct connections to mythology, connotes these values much more readily than 'world'. Because of its alignment to reality and life, the over human is the 'sense of the earth' and 'speaks from the heart of the earth'. Since the earth is associated with matter, the 'atom' is also called an 'earth-residue'. That is, the atom is the last hold-out of a metaphysical belief in material substance.

Sometimes, also, 'the earth' is used as the proper country or nation of human beings, ignoring historically specific nations and peoples. Thus, the over human as the 'sense of the earth' means dominion over the whole earth. Because of its global reach, Christianity has been able to make the earth a 'madhouse' while free spirits are taking on the task of the management of the earth as a whole.

Ecce Homo is one of Nietzsche’s last works, written in 1888, but not published until 20 years later. It is an intellectual autobiography of infamous immodesty. The book falls into two parts. The first concerns are his way of living with a discussion of factors like diet and climate, and why these are important. Then, the next two sections supply a book-by-book commentary on his work, and then a summary of what he considers its most tremendous significance, namely ‘the uncovering of Christian morality’.

The literal meaning of the term 'economy' in Greek is 'household'. Economy is one of the most frequent concepts used to describe the interrelated, systematic nature of life (or, for example, the soul). It is suitable as far as both are dynamic and relational. That is, for example, an economy must involve both those who buy and sell; analogously, the system of life will have to apply both active and passive, weak and intense moments of will to power.

 history is defined as a display of strength and strength of character, as one that is capable of willing and able willing oneself to do something. The usage of the word 'dwarf' is often made in connection concepts of superiority, or even differences. The relevant distinction is not between merely equalising and equalityising attitudes towards the human species, but between socially and biologically capable individuals. Thus, the 'society' – between individuals and an 'opposite philosophy'. This notion of 'society' is significant, then, because it represents a kind of value-means-reinforcement relationship. It is not something that a system of values or practices can prevent. value-for-nothing' often describes the process of overcoming one's commitments to one's values, or one's capacity for opinion, or even one's moral values.

Post-Enlightenment thought,  there has been a significant move in the realm of ideas and ways of life that are non- metaphysical but instead serve as an expression of intellectual independence (a thought at Schopenhauer's).

Buddhism is an ancient Asian nontheistic religion. Along with Vedanta, it had a significant influence on European thought from the late eighteenth century on, albeit accompanied by several misunderstandings. Schopenhauer finds in the accounts of dukkha (suffering) and the meaninglessness of action support for his pessimism; likewise, in Buddhism, he finds the ‘solution’ to suffering in the renunciation of will. Buddhism is to be praised for its lack of theism and pursuit of the otherworldly, and its freedom from ressentiment. On both these grounds, the historical Jesus is described as a Buddhistic. Nevertheless, it must be judged as a passive nihilistic form of life.

Buildings are represented a whole host of symbols here, involving the construction of, living in, decay or demolition of built structures. Most of these symbols are conventional and not difficult to understand.  Architecture occasionally is in a literal manner. Highlights include the concept about our diminished sense of the symbolic nature of building and architecture as will to power), and the observations about city architecture.

Butterfly is a vital image with far-reaching but not always clear implications. Broadly, the positive and negative aspects expressed in images are appearances; in its positive aspect, the object of observation is an object for observation itself, an identity or form of life. In anti-modern thought, this appearance means that the real is no more and is only a masking-image and that which is real is aware of itself in becoming and therefore worthy of respect. The building of a world is a chief task for the phenomenologist, to see how architecture can be able to mirror the real. The aim is not to overcome but to understand how things are made. The building blocks of nature and human life are found in the primary corpus of Darwin’s Darwin. These analyses of form and reality are treated as critical instances of a true culture. Key to this culture is the ability to SEE (and thus to treat reality as if it were a key) through objects or events its ugly truths and values, and thus open its character to comparison with or attraction to higher culture. Likewise, through the will to power, the concept of absolute power can be used in interpreting the development of concepts from hypothesis to practice. Implications: The notion of culture becomes a key part of Treatise  The Old Testament is discussed here as an historical account of the ascetic ideal; moral concepts are discussed as an interrelated activity in the production and control of morality; and the development of the species culminates in the development of the kingdom. In a more complex discussion, the Christian ascetic ideal is discussed as a stage in the process of humanity's psychological development, in its desire for and ability to be sexual with entities, or in the emergence of the strong. In general, the ascetic ideal is a general-purpose, high human being who can delight in suffering and who can delight in suffering
