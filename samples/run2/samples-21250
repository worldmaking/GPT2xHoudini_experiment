 or the conditions of the growth of life, and the lousy health that follows from such bad health. So, for example, the health of the animal is a measure of the same object – ‘Homer’s Contest’. Second, the same Homer’s epic is a product of the rule of Zeus: the serpent. Third, the sun is the symbol of the cloud – the cloud is the one who obscures the real. The story of the Christian and Jewish people and the ascetic priest – and the priest in the Apollonian playsa – gave their wholehearted support and devotion to the gods. Still, some of these ideas apply also to Buddhism. Epictetus as a whole is an attempt to revalue the idea of guilt involved in the ascetic ideal, and to understand it as a universal. Strauss and Sadler (eds.) point out that empathy is a phrase that begins with 'love', and stands for a crucial difference'. Thus, 'love and gratitude' are adjectives of gratitude for having been a good person; id 'life', for having felt the weight of a great achievement; and energetic'  Sadler has 'spun out' 'pityed' out. Importantly, there is a striking contrast to selfishness and selfishness in its opposite: active and active 'activity' is employed to deepen and modernize the description of the human (for a new morality is implied). This is a cooing and giving (i.e. 'pity' to oneself) and 'action' towards the world. 'Action' also seems to be associated with the new philosophers of chemistry and poetry.

The other side of 'action' is 'activity' with dreams. Silber and Zarathustra both say that 'activity' is the most familiar description of the nature of good and evil.  'Act' thus describes the 'cruel and perverse ways in which we act' (the joke at the expense of a joke) 'I do my part in the growth of the human, and the growth of the will to power. My actions are the beginning of a new set of rules for the development of the human. My friends and my enemies are the rules I need to follow'. The idea is that a network of power and power-relations – that is through all human beings and institutions, from the state to the church – is the preferred means of achieving this end. Russia is already a city, but its action network.

The concept of 'creation' continues even after the decline of the Christian concept. In Christian thought, for example, 'ology' is used to revalue specific claims about the nature of things, or of the nature of certain philosophical or social concepts. Instead, 'creation' is associated with the discovery of new senses of meaning in things and with changes in external state.

'Creation' also describes the development of the concept of eternal recurrence from the passive to the active, and the mixed results. In all these instances, 'creation' is by no means always necessary. For example, the origin of the 'spirit of gravity' may be in the usage of creation without master? Likewise, what is the significance of perfection in 'creation'. Likewise, what is the value of selfishness without a master? What is the significance, if any, of the 'creation of the slaves?' A key passage describes creating slaves by assigning them to masters. Then, the masters create their slaves, and then the humans become creators. The point is: Creators require human beings to be creative in some way, way. So, for example, creation of the slave is a way of animating the human being into a creature of high creativeness. Creators are assigned to other human beings, too, in the tradition of the ascetic ideal.

A common theme about contemplation was the contrast between the vita contemplative and the vita active (or vita practice) – between the life of contemplation and that of action. In fact, it is a false distinction. The two modes are two halves of a whole, an action seeking itself in the future, contemplation in the past. However, certain spirits are merely reactive – whose values are always generated from out of a hatred of the values of others, or whose highest state is to serve – the vita contemplative can and should be a kind of action - ‘thinking well is an action’. This action may involve leadership or creativity in the realm of ideas or instances of self-overcoming. It is not merely renunciation. Luther’s Reformation was a hatred of contemplative types. Precisely because of this rejection, the Reformation was a historical disaster. In the accelerating tempo of modern life, contemplation is virtually impossible. The task here, then, is to rescue contemplation from the Church, to revalue the concept away from traditional forms, for example

 or even more so, the philosopher is anything at all who can affirm the existence of things-in-themselves. That is, things-in-themselves are not, say, matter or energy; they speak to one thing and Chaos also warns us to be patient and not to think from afar. Thus, the idea of communication is not primarily about the physical (i.e. touching), but also about the will to power and the will to power. Here, the chance is small and only chance presents its challenges as if they are some vast, cosmic cosmic arrangement. This idea of chance is unlike in the history of science or German. The concept of chance is employed in several interconnected ways. First, it is a common one, with the idea of class, since its development has been a theme of cultural and religious accounts of history. Second, though, contentment is not the same as causality, and thus the former includes both the action and the contemplation of causes and effects. Third, and most importantly, there is the notion of contentment only insofar as it relates to affects. That is, if there are goals and affects, it is only an action if and only a consequence if it be a consequence, then an even playing field is needed. In other words, if a herd of cows produces a figure-happening, then that figure-happening is an action. So, for example, the ‘conscious aware is the pathos of extent’. Second, such ‘pathos’ is an understatement. The ‘dirt’ around ‘China’ is, in a sense, a recognition of the destructive power of the self and viewed as a kind of energy that can bridge the gap between ourselves and our values. Indeed, the pathos of the healthy and healthy forms of life, the life that is genuine, is selfishness. In contrast, the ‘righteous’ should be praised for not striving, for having the strength to look down. Indeed, the beautiful thing about the pathos of distance is that it influences and is inspired on every aspect of our existence. So,  there is a  good analogy there: every good old way of living is an affirming of everything that is in some way perverse, or a way of dodging certain dangers. So, the old serpent is the new way of living.

There is the idea of eternal recurrence in 'cycle'. Also, on a broad historical scale, there are repeated patterns of the formation of cultural forms of life, their corruption, the emergence of individuals and a slave revolution. In the life of the philosopher, there is a cycle of creative overflowing, followed by a period of exhaustion or convalescence; or, similarly, the investigation of dangerous and ugly topics, followed by 'running out into the sunlight'; likewise, Zarathustra repeatedly goes down and then up to his mountains. The symbols of feminine and masculine are also used as a means of exploring this idea. Finally, religious fervour is found with Folie circularize – Falter's phrase for what is now called manic depression or bipolar disorder – in its alternation of feelings of ecstatic redemption followed by severe penitence. Metaphorically, night and day, the seasons of the year, and the life cycle of organisms (the cycle of growth and reproduction, or of life and death) are employed to illustrate such cycles – along with associated mythical allusions, such as the life of Dionysus.

Dance is defined as a display of strength and agility, but one that is graceful, as if only a sign of still further reserves of strength and agility, which the description could also be of the noble. The ancient Greeks lived dancelike in this sense; dialogue in Sophocles has this character. Dance thus serves as an analogy for Dionysian insight apprehended calmly in an Apollonian vision; for the overcoming of shame in the healthy and beautiful body; likewise, for the conception of freedom of will as self-determination, taking leave of certainty and dancing beside the abyss – this notion should recall the tight rope ‘dancer’; and generally as the ideal of philosophy, which needs to be able to work with both science and art, accomplished in both but constrained by neither, even though this means an absolute inevitable scientific ignorance. German philosophers got criticised, for whom thinking is nothing like dancing, struggling without a ‘finger for nuance’. Wagner is found – and implicitly criticised – for moving music away from dance and its ideal of self-possession even amidst emotional enthusiasm.

Zarathustra walks like a dancer, a sign of the self-overcoming during his long sojourn in the mountains. ‘The Dance Song’ is explicitly there to advocate against the ‘spirit of gravity’, the enemy of anyone who would seek to overcome such burdens. In accord with this conception

 or the human condition. A key passage in this regard would be Zarathustra on the ‘preachers of death’. Action must be among the characteristics of a good conscience; a good conscience is one capable of allowing some action away from some action already there is no furthering of that action. It is a ‘pathos of exhaustion’. Some people with a passion for music such as Bachonzi create a soundtrack to their action, but this is not their ‘action’. There is the ‘strong artistic soul’, and the creative individual or group can and should pursue its development in the life of its essence.

Ape primate as akin to the animal aspect of humans’ pre-dates Darwin; with Darwin thought arises the notion of a common evolutionary ancestor. The ape, then, is either an origin or disfigured mirror-image, of which we are ashamed. The ape is an imitator, unaware even of being an imitator, and which brings disrepute to the imitated.

Aphorisms is a brief, self-contained and striking piece of writing, usually gathered in sequences. Aphoristic writing was common in ancient literature and was employed by many authors. First, a random series of very brief sayings or epigrams, and second a series of longer pieces, each like a short study. There are a few added variations. Likewise, and regardless of the presence of an overarching theme to the series, aphorisms can speak to each other, as if they were short segments of a continuous piece of writing. 

The different rhythms of these various ways of writing and the different interpretative demands make on readers. The function of such writing as fully developed thoughts with either maximally compressed, or fragmentary, expression and an ‘immortal’ perfection of the form; aphorisms serve as a kind of test of readers; or an interpretative task set to readers, perhaps because the expression is deliberately incomplete.

Apollonian is named after the Greek God Apollo; this is one of three drives that it is a key to understanding cultural production and cultural change, from the ancient  Greek world on. The other two are Dionysian and Socratic. A  brief period in which the Apollonian and Dionysian work together produces ancient tragedy. The Apollonian is the origin of those cultural forms where beauty and clarity of form are emphasised (examples would be epic poetry, architecture, and sculpture), and the effects of calm or cheerfulness. Apollonian implicitly carries with it a metaphysical view concerning reality, that is, the belief that individual entities are ontologically original. Importantly, though, the Apollonian is also characterised by an awareness that these valued forms are an illusion to a Dionysian view of existence (a dream in which we are aware we are dreaming). Thus, the Apollonian should not be understood as a kind of self-deception or turning away from the real (that would be more akin to the Socratic). In his later work, the Apollonian is no longer thought of as a competing, brother drive to the Dionysian, but as a moment (of calm, stillness, beauty, image, etc.) within the latter. This is implicitly acknowledged that the ‘complete and authentic antagonism’ is between Homer and Plato: the former the deifier of life, the latter its ‘slanderer’.

The fundamental characteristic of things as they appear to us, including ourselves and bodies, is their givenness as individual form. This is Schopenhauer’s principium individuationis and the veil of Maya. Schopenhauer, in turn, was trying to interpret Kant’s distinction between appearances and things-in-themselves and incorporate ideas from Eastern thought. ‘Behind’ appearances are the will, continually striving and becoming, without form. Here, an important distinction arises between two senses of appearance: appearance as a symbolic image in genuine art, versus appearance as mere copy, and thus as possibly deceptive. Socratic thought is the forgetting of the first possibility of occurrence,  and therefore also as the advent of a modern faith in science. This theme continues throughout his career and involves analyses of how that which merely appears is denigrated for some ‘beyond’ or ‘behind’.

Human feeling is from the ground up, a simplification of the world so that it appears as intelligible, predictable, available for human beings to use. The ultimate motive behind this is utility: without such interpretations, human beings could not survive. Moreover, different peoples interpret things according to their specific situation (e.g. climate, resources, their enemies). Thus,
