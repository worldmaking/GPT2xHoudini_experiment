To breed means to select reproductive pairs to emphasise or cut certain inherited traits. Bought characteristics can be inherited, which is an outdated concept of biological inheritance. If we think of breeding on a broader sense, as the inheriting of selected values by way of institutions (such as education or church), then it is more plausible—a school ‘breeds’ in the sense that it values and passes on specific characteristics. The concept is in both a negative and positive sense. In a negative sense, Christianity is a procedure for breeding herd-like features, and physical and psychological illnesses, into populations. The domestication aimed at by Christianity from the breeding (in a strict sense) aimed at in Hindu culture, but the process is not dissimilar. In a positive sense, breeding is how peoples came to be, by favouring those characteristics that enabled survival under challenging conditions, which then became virtues. Likewise, breeding is the taking charge of human development, rather than leaving it to lucky accidents.

The image of a bridge is conventional that it is an opportunity for overcoming (for growth, development, progress of some type), and it has value for that reason alone. Thus, the human is a bridge and not a goal. Also, the passage called ‘On Redemption’ takes place on a ‘great bridge’. The ascetic ideal is, for a philosophy, a unique bridge to his or her conditions of growth. The priests are scolded for believing that there is ‘but one bridge’ (i.e. a universalising morality and monotheism), and the tyrant believes all history has been a bridge to him. A more complex analogy of a bridge is used to discuss the idea of the Republic of Genius, which is understood as a goal.

Buddhism is an ancient Asian nontheistic religion. Along with Vedanta, it had a significant influence on European thought from the late eighteenth century on, albeit accompanied by several misunderstandings. Schopenhauer finds in the accounts of dukkha (suffering) and the meaninglessness of action support for his pessimism; likewise, in Buddhism, he finds the ‘solution’ to suffering in the renunciation of will. Buddhism is to be praised for its lack of theism and pursuit of the otherworldly, and its freedom from ressentiment. On both these grounds, the historical Jesus is described as a Buddhistic. Nevertheless, it must be judged as a passive nihilistic form of life.

Buildings are represented a whole host of symbols here, involving the construction of, living in, decay or demolition of built structures. Most of these symbols are conventional and not difficult to understand.  Architecture occasionally is in a literal manner. Highlights include the concept about our diminished sense of the symbolic nature of building and architecture as will to power), and the observations about city architecture.

Burckhardt’s historical approach which viewed as potentially necessary all aspects of culture.

Butterfly is a vital image with far-reaching but not always clear implications. Broadly, the image of butterfly is in a negative, though also in a positive way. The critical meaning of the former is thoughtless living in and for the present. Butterfly is thus modern humanity with its newspapers and petty politics. There are two aspects to the positive meaning. First, the butterfly is childlike, innocent, and therefore able to relate to its world without the heaviness of values. Second, the butterfly is a standard mode of existence, lightly and laughingly affirming of its conditions and its fate. The butterfly, in this sense, is also eager for growth. The butterfly is used in this sense, but now with an emphasis on the problematic sacrifices that are the precondition of such growth. The idea of cocoon is about the Apollonian cultural drive being forced to disguise itself as mania for persuasion, but re-emerging in modernity.

 are those within the social group has a self -immanent cultural influence, cultural drives in the pursuit of knowledge, or drives within an organisation who are primarily directed towards the future, but also serve to guide and inspire. The development of consciousness is a way – albeit an enormously wasteful way – of trying to correct an organism that has gone wrong. Being conscious shows imperfection. The goal – even the purpose of knowledge itself – is not consciousness, but the rectification of the instincts.

A common theme about contemplation was the contrast between the vita contemplative and the vita active (or vita practice) – between the life of contemplation and that of action. In fact, it is a false distinction. The two modes are two halves of a whole, an action seeking itself in the future, contemplation in the past. However, certain spirits are merely reactive – whose values are always generated from out of a hatred of the values of others, or whose highest state is to serve – the vita contemplative can and should be a kind of action - ‘thinking well is an action’. This action may involve leadership or creativity in the realm of ideas or instances of self-overcoming. It is not merely renunciation. Luther’s Reformation was a hatred of contemplative types. Precisely because of this rejection, the Reformation was a historical disaster. In the accelerating tempo of modern life, contemplation is virtually impossible. The task here, then, is to rescue contemplation from the Church, to revalue the concept away from traditional forms, for example making it contemplation on the closest things.

‘Contentment’ is in the sense of a cosy and safe relationship with one’s existing mode of life. Examples would include the contentment [Behave] with one’s limitations and narrow-mindedness found in the ‘cultural philistine’, and the ‘wretched contentment’ of the ‘last humans’ described by Zarathustra. On the other hand, contentment as an occasional refuge for those with difficult tasks or who suffer. Therefore, the attitude to such the view depends upon whether this contentment is an end or an instrument within the duty of the furtherance of life.

Whatever a continuum is that is given initially (sensation, nervous stimulation, etc.) is characterized by continuous flow, and not by discrete and stable qualities and quantities. In other words, only things are not given initially, but our cognition of them is a product of the action of perception (interpretation). Likewise, our analysis of causes and effects must first separate and make discrete that which is the cause and that which is an effect, from out of a continuum.

Control and Self-control denote reperching, among others. The idea of having control, especially over the self, is an essential source of the feeling of power. This can be in an ascetic sense, involving subordination of the self to an impossible or metaphysical ideal. Or it can be in the spirit of a productive subtlety in the war against oneself (self-overcoming). Self-control can also be associated with courage or strength.

Convalescence means the course of suffering and surviving from illnesses caused by physiologies or cultures. The sickness led from cultures, in a sense, is by no means entirely metaphorical - that is ideas, beliefs, values, or modes of life that one has inherited and with which he or she is surrounded. When we talk about ‘convalescence’, it usually links to this second kind of illness, and its overcoming, in mind. Convalescence as an overcoming is thus contrasted to comforting as a relieving of suffering. Convalescence is also part of the cycle of creative states, linked to exhaustion and the need for repose.

A conviction is a belief, held stubbornly to be 'unqualified truth'. There is a notion developed by the dangers and origin of conviction that one must be a 'noble traitor' to one's convictions. Convictions are opposed by both the genius of science and justice. Therefore, those who embrace science and justice are considered as the wanderer,  a thinker who has no home or 'destination' (both understood as convictions).

Courage and bravery are an ancient virtue that we need to appreciate and revalue. Courage is the ability to stick firmly to life and the real, and not to borrow one’s beliefs and values from imaginary other worlds or modes of being. Likewise, it is courage not to manufacture one’s beliefs and values by a fearful negation of becoming, uncertainty and suffering, which are

 are the ways of survival and growth in the world make knowledge possible. In other words, ‘the discoveries that are always merely intellectual—the contemplative life’, and the philosopher must be neither merely individuals but rather is a network of power and power-relations – that is, a kind of strength. Its capacity to defend or resist is obvious. Moreover, the network of power-relations – that is to say, life considered as the will to power (together with the feeling of growing or diminishing power) – is the basis of many moral practices. Likewise, the network of power-relations – between them, and between earlier and modern ideas of the reciprocal dependence of good and evil, and between early and mid-century – is both healthy and unhealthy.

The notion of ‘category’ has a long history of philosophy, beginning with Aristotle. In Kant, the categories form a set of 12 essential and a priori concepts under which all experience falls. They thus describe the structure of experience and its limits but also supply a transcendental account of how knowledge is possible in the first place.

Causality is one of the critical physical and metaphysical lines of thought. There are several aspects. Although using some of the same concepts as ‘On Truth and Lies’useful as a kind of shorthand for describing and predicting, the concepts of cause and effect require us to posit the cause and the effect as separable and identifiable; that is, each must be a stable entity. In truth, a continuum faces us, and every causal event is an infinite number of processes. Cause and effect thus offer no real understanding or explanation. This simplifying treatment of cause and effect is founded upon a natural, but mistaken, analysis of will – our clear willing and effecting becomes a model for natural processes. Cause and effect do not follow ‘laws. This notion of natural law as something that ‘governs’ also is an illegitimate application of our (mistaken) notion of willing according to a maxim. The critique of causality also amounts to an evaluation of mechanical thought (all nature consists of pushing and pulling entities). Natural causality is replaced by the concept of a network of forces – that is with the will to power. Among other things, this new concept demands (as against mechanism) ‘action at a distance’. Importantly,  this concept of cause and effect includes a diagnosis of the psychological needs that might explain its adoption.

Second, there are some natural processes at work that are gestured towards by the concept of cause and effect. This whole natural realm contrasts with an unnatural or anti-natural sense of cause and effect: the idea of a sin against God, ‘spiritual causality’, or the cause of itself that is both an account of God but also a model of free will. In all these cases, a cause is posited that lies outside the natural order.

The third strand of thought concerning causality is the notion of sublimation, in which a force or desire has its ‘direction’ changed – that is, its mode of discharge – by a second force or passion. There, the distinction between a vast quantum of power, and a smaller trigger, serves to give the former direction. The latter would be the ends we set ourselves for tasks or our lives. But these are often ‘beautifying pretexts’ – the real function of the discharge is hidden from us.

There are many caves in Greek mythology. The first one is the Dikeman Cave where the infant Zeus was born and hidden away from his father Chronos (time); the second one is the cave near Mount Kylene where Maia gave birth to Hermes (god of travel and herald of the gods), son of Zeus; the third one is the cave near Mount Nysa where Dionysus (another son of Zeus) was raised by nymphs,  hidden from Hera’s jealousy.

The other primary classical source for the image of the cave is Plato. In The Republic, Plato uses the ‘allegory of the cave’ to describe the journey of the philosopher, who flees the imaginary images in the cave (appearances), up to the sunlight (the forms as genuine entities illuminated by genuine light), and then back again to aid others in escaping. The cave, rather than being a dark place of illusion, is depth (in the sense of profundity) but is also elevated in the mountains. When we step out before the sun, it is not to gain insight, but to bestow it on others. Similarly, the figure of a cave to talk about the solitude of the free spirit; and, the cave is the depths of insight compared to the superficial daylight of modernity.
