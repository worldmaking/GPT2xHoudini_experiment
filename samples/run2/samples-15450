 of that which is the most cowardly; that is, a class of creatures in which the greatest gift is a clarity of thoughtlessness, orlustritis, which is the inability to have 'errors' – that is, a hatred of anything like the beauty of simplicity, or singularity, or eternity. Such a deity suffers from both religious and moral obscenity.

Energy is the ability to do work. It is a little like a mirror – only without the need of any of these objects. There are two broad ways of saying this: either these values are not in the habit of moving towards continuous affirmation or merely not matching the identity of 'value' to 'being' at all. This is a product of the selection of energetic practices and types; likewise, the development of the kind of 'value' that is not 'human'. Likewise, human types become more and more differentiated within a 'society' – this is both a defining characteristic of modernity – from the diversity of 'good' and 'evil' types. Finally, the history of value has entered a 'recoil' that is 'better' and is responsible for the 'freedom' it forces upon itself. The 'power' of value is clear – and again, the following discussion of the relationship of 'value' to 'power'.

The emancipated spirit initially attains or stays within the number of a specific great Spirit. Then, after a period of development, pride, emptiness or resentment of fate transform into enthusiasm for life and productive ideas. It takes pride in the phenomenal and the apparent, in their concrete causes and consequences, and rejects the 'false beauty of tragedy' and 'infrequent turns' of history. It is incapable of giving in to demands, and instead turns towards the future. It is thus a gender-bordered group. The emancipated soul then becomes aware of itself as the 'rider of tomorrow', 'sneaking' to the notion of eternity (although not by accident). The cycle of existence is repeated and one day 'it all comes to a head'. At worst, it is a triumphant nihilistic 'lunch'. The banner of nihilism is that which claims to speak for all beings, but in fact affirm eternal recurrence. That is to say, the claiming of eternal recurrence is a reiteration of the process of creation.

A criminal is a lawbreaker, someone who acts against accepted traditions. There are three essential ideas. First, the observation that changes or developments in-laws are made, often enough, because of lawbreakers. The ‘free-doer’ and the criminal will at one stage be subjected to the same defamation. Second, it is the concept of punishment that the notion of retribution from the fact that someone outside the social contract is effectively at war with that society; sanction is thus the criminal expelled. Also, this notion is pursued that our behaviour towards the criminal should not be founded on revenge, but rehabilitation or healing from an illness. Punishment is a means of keeping power by having the right to find guilty and impose the law. Third, it is about the psychology of responsibility, the state of having the strength to act but not having the power later to affirm the act. Thus, the portrait of the pale criminal. This idea is related to N’s perseverance or courage in passages. There is also a line of thought – an endpoint of the softening of morality – that denies all responsibility, and for that reason treats the criminal very differently.

The concept of critique has both a broader and a narrower meaning. The general sense of critique is to approach an object, especially some cultural object, such as a historical text, objectively and without pre-conceptions, to understand it or evaluate it. Thus, today, we might talk about a literary critic or film critic, and a philosophy student might be asked to ‘critically appraise’ an idea. An essential historical influence here is ‘critical hermeneutics’, an eighteenth and nineteenth-century mode of study that viewed biblical texts as historical objects rather than as revelation or, at least, not as pure revelation. The discipline of philology here is, to a considerable degree influenced by early hermeneutics.

The narrower concept of critique stems primarily from Kant, where it has a specific philosophical meaning. For Kant, ‘critique’ means to investigate the basis of any human ability (e.g. understanding, judgement, reason) to discover both its fundamental, a priori principles and its limits. The laws are what gives that ability its legitimacy, which is to say a guarantee of its value concerning specific goals (e.g. the principles of the understanding make possible knowledge of the natural world); the limits define possible usages of the ability which are illegitimate (e.g. knowledge of a supernatural world

 of 'action'. Action, therefore, has both a moral and a physiological sense. The active one, while not entirely unrighted, is precisely an overcoming of one’s previous state by another.

anasia is the infliction of severe pain on an object (or system of experiences) by which the end is meant both of the possessor’s happiness and that of the system of rule or growth. The idea is that after the pain has been inflicted, the possessor’s system of behaviour or ideas becomes undone. The system continues even after it is reformed into a practical law, making it possible to  ‘critically critique’ the system’s moral values. After the critique has been made, the system can no longer be ‘historic’ but is also ‘future’, serving its full significance.

The concept of "proselytisation" here is not to abolish it, but to change it. If we think of abolition more as a function of the desire for power (the slave revolt was an example), but instead as a specific way of disposing of those who are illegitimate (and thus to be disposed differently to one) then redistribution is not the same as becoming complicit in the formation of nobility. That is, if liberation from privilege are a function of improving one’s health and condition then so be it a ‘role model’ for future generations. However, if improving one’s health and condition is a function of demand and interpretation then so be it a’s’ contribution from the realm of possibilities.

Any number of other symbols may refer to this concept of cleanliness, such as fresh air, clarity, brightness, health, nakedness. Cleanliness is opposed to filth, dirt, murky waters. It should be noted that Leiblichkeit has the same root as rein or Reinet (pure, purity) and these concepts have something of a moral and religious connotation.

Cleanly, to be sure. – One who dresses in clean- washed rags covers cleanly, to be sure, but still raggedly. Its point is to distinguish between a literal and figurative meaning of cleanliness – the latter corresponds to something like nobility. In other words, a condition of the possibility of nobility is not wealth, but freedom from abject poverty. Analogously, the cleanliness of a child ‘transforms’ itself into something more spiritual later, including ‘purity’.

Another aspect of the symbolic meaning of cleanliness is honesty. That is, purity now refers to a set of intellectual practices that refuse unclear thought practices, particularly those that defer to a metaphysical beyond (e.g. religious institutions and the beliefs they embody).  The notion that religion (Christianity in part or itself a form of religion) is not clean enough for the spirit is made again. This functions as a kind of summary of the critical reflection of Christianity. Particularly pertinent to this image is the crucial thought of Christianity in terms of its darkness or murkiness, that is its willingness to be dishonest. Also bound up in the perception of uncleanliness is Christianity’s association with the herd or slaves; its attempt to crush nobility; its moral attitudes are often masking lecherous desires; its contempt for the body creates filth (e.g. in sexuality) – indeed, even cleanliness is seen as sensuousness, that is as filth.  Cleanliness as innocence is, of course, also a reference to the blood of Christ as cleansing one of sin; the ironic point here is that the Christian idea of sin is what creates the ‘dirt’ in the first place.

However, the type of uncleanliness is not the worst thing; the worst thing is shallowness. This is a typical characteristic of modernity, especially in Germany. It is the product of a democratic community. The point concerns distance; that is, a herd is defined not by numbers, or cleanliness in an ordinary sense, but by thinking, speaking, and acting as one, and by assuming equality (e.g. touching). This is unclean in a spiritual sense because it must involve falsifications or simplifications, passivity, and weakness, and because it leads to a stagnation of the human. Thus, what is unclean is ‘common’. Once a work has been produced (e.g. an act done, a book published) then it is in the collective sphere; if saw at all, it becomes universal. Nobility cannot be judged, then, by acts or works. Only a noble reserve, solitude and self-respect could keep its spiritual cleanliness.

Similarly, what is healthy in one's culture is not necessarily in one's people; instead, this culture is itself a product of death. Thus, decadence is also the task of a new ‘new age’. Day’s presence is necessary for growth, affirmation of one’s place within the social order, and so forth. The day can be godly ecstasy, or dark secrets of self-overcoming. ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ forces the reader to watch for wrinkles, and thus ‘give birth to a child’. The figure of the child员�s name in a dream.The expression ‘what did you dream of’ is an example of the need to simplify. An even more extensive example of this thought is the idea of would-be Marxists or New Democracy champions of the idea is that which proposes to transform oneself into nature. To do so would be a double betrayal of oneself, a deviation or distortion of the life one is, resulting in all kinds of physical or spiritual degeneration. In the end, what is known is your opinionated, ‘youaking’ opinion, or more often, your sense of time’.

‘Culture’ means a form of life that people has set up for itself. This culture encapsulates their values, is what allows people both to have an identity and to reproduce and reinforce that identity over time, and which also allows people to produce excellence or greatness. The concept of culture can be used broadly, to designate types of culture that span dozens of nations and hundreds of years (e.g. ‘Alexandrian’ or ‘Hellenic’); or narrowly, to discuss individual peoples or sub-groups (such as ‘noble culture’ ). Culture includes everything from mundane practices (e.g. diet, daily routines), through institutions (church, military, education) up to ‘high’ culture (literature and art).

Culture is thought of as the variety of ways that the underlying Will has of keeping a people alive, and especially stimulating or tricking ‘nobler natures’ who feel the burden of being. There has a distinguish between an authentic and an inauthentic (or dispersed) culture, and similarly between lower and higher. Authentic culture can be defined as one that is unified, and which still serves a vital purpose of all culture, which is to produce genius or greatness. The dispersion of culture happens through the influence of the drive for knowledge, especially historical knowledge, which eventually turns culture into a mere patchwork of styles or practices borrowed randomly from the past, and without the dynamism to take on future projects. The Socratic drive for knowledge cannot be eliminated; instead, the task of culture is to incorporate it into a unity. This concern associates understanding the integration of culture and aids its development in modernity.

Furthermore, the concept of culture also becomes aligned to the conception of power but stays similar in essential respects. Higher culture comprises the feeling of power and the growth of power; indeed, higher culture always begins with barbarians, perhaps with contempt for and the destruction of a previous decadent culture, but in any case with the ‘lust for power’ and cruelty with a good conscience. Cultural advances depend upon power differences and the ‘pathos of distance’; in turn, this means that culture is a ‘pyramid’ with a broad base of workers. Contrasted to higher culture is one based on various forms of physical or spiritual narcotization or making ill (the ‘madhouses of culture’). It is this lack of a future, a lack of awareness that there could or should be future possibilities, that causes deeply disturbing.

In the beginning, Zarathustra calls himself ‘cunning’ when he refuses to reveal that he is using the honey as bait for the higher men. Such cunning, that is, has entered the philosopher’s ‘fishing tackle’ as serving his or her comprehensive responsibility for the development of humans into the future. This becomes explicit that where ‘perhaps’ cunning provides more favourable conditions than scholarship for the development of the philosopher – and again, the following section where cunning is the ‘kindness’ behind the mask. 

Cunning is also associated with the ability to find a way to preserve a diseased or decadent life. These two usages are not in contradiction but are a recognition of the amoral truth that not all battles can be fought in the open, with displays of force.
