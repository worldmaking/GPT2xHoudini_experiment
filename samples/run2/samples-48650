 can only present an image of the inner necessity in the life of an actual human being. Therefore, people of ‘strong character’ are created through education in just this way, to be more like art than life and thus to be useful to their community. The genuinely more energetic spirit, however, will ‘give style’ to their character, force it into the realm of apparent characteristics. Likewise, intellectual conscience will ‘give style’ to have any value, and to feel pleasure at having been able to make mistakes. Such style can be good or bad, and any number of outsized or short effects. Such ‘good’ are called ‘inspiration’. The point is that, for example, simplicity is a dangerous ‘heroic’ necessary spirit, and likewise, the ‘great is not so much a watchdog as a watchdog's advocate – that is, an even mixed bag will be a watchdog's protection and a mixed category of humans who are in direct contradiction of the ‘great’ idea of affirmation (i.e. not willing the task of creating values or justifying their practice).

The concept of being also available as part of a comprehensive idea of how history has been organized, written, and used. The concept is derived from Epicureanism but is different and does not involve the metaphysical implications. The book is heavily influenced (although not entirely uncritically) by Schopenhauer, and especially in its third part plays homage to Wagner.

Otto von Bismarck was the leading political figure in Germany from the 1860s to 1890. Bismarck provoked wars that in turn led to the unification of Germany around Prussian leadership. His brand of pragmatic and power politics, and his nationalism, made him as a symbol of all that was wrong with modern Germany.

Blood is a metaphor of life and a key symbol in Christianity for a life made eternal by being cleansed of sin. Notably, blood stands for the specific mode of life of an individual or group; thus, history transformed into blood: morals part of our ‘flesh and blood’. Blood is accumulated and passed down, forming peoples, types, or families (Geblüt means belonging to an aristocratic family line). Blood is that which makes one strong and capable of creating so that we have the vampire or leech images; also, the life-draining of specific ideas or practices, revenge, or asceticism or nihilism. Blood is precious; therefore, the mention thereof aphorisms and of things written in blood being an effort to read. Blood is also courage and the love of danger so that which is written in blood will take risks and those who read it to take risks with themselves.  Blood means sacrifice or martyrdom, which the idea is related to Christian symbolism, but also to Bismarck’s famous speech in 1862, where he uses the phrase ‘iron and blood’ to describe a nationalistic foreign policy not afraid to risk warfare.

Body means the human body as opposed to just any material object. If one rejects dualism – an account of the mind or soul as fundamentally different from, even separable from, the body – then bodily states are sensations, appetites, passions and so on, and thought and reason. In turn, this means that the one set of processes (those traditionally associated with a body) and the other (those usually associated with a mind) will require a similar set of explanatory accounts—this joint descriptive account in a materialistic account of physiology. The will to power seems to provide such an account that does not involve the metaphysical commitments of materialism. Moreover, these two sets must also influence each other (indeed overlap or coincide) much more than is thought. Importantly, the individual body is not necessarily the primary object of enquiry – groups based on gender, class, or race are treated as effectively one body. That is, certain groups are effectively a single organism. For example, the mobility and intermarriage of various human types vertically across classes, and geographically across Europe and beyond, has created mixed physiologies and thus also new types of cultural forces or possibilities.

Similarly, this account of the body explains with the concept of health or growth in both physical and spiritual ways, and with practices like diet, cleanliness, or discipline.  Through such methods, bodies can be developed (or made ill) through what sometimes calls internalisation or incorporation.

The sickness of the body, and a misunderstanding of this sickness, forms the whole of philosophy. The most obvious example of this is the denigration of the body and what are taken to be its characteristics: sex, desire, sensuality, potent effects of all kinds. From this denigration arise certain

 can be found. Pity is viewed as a means of keeping power by having the right to find guilty and impose the law. Sustaining the peace requires both scholarly or scientific knowledge and a disciplined form of life. The former, might be founded on creation, knowledge of facts and logic. The world is thus childlike, innocent, and not cruel to those who are cleverly provoked against the dominant culture. Education should not be understood as merely predicting the future but as a means of diverting the life course. A critical sense is that which is the philosopher’s ability to refuse the faith of others. The teaching of science as power, rather than knowledge of fact, and not friendship, is a crucial symbol.

The concept of critique has two different meanings in both English and German. First, critique involves the operation of the intellect as the function of a school ('neither the critic nor the scholar. Thecriticism involves the evaluation of the human-animal'.), and second, the animal can mean that aspect of the human that does or should cause shame, or any of the other entities who are human-like but also having a creative will to the future. The animal can mean anything, but only very narrowly. The category of culture means that it is not something only to be distinguished from it, as well as from any other entity. Such multiplicity means that at the root of things (e.g. knowledge, love, wisdom) ‘it is welcomed’. Second, though, this same stability itself endangers the health or growth of life. So. then, the philosopher-hermit means that part of us is incapable of good or moral character, or of keeping a tight rein on the crimes that are supposed to befall humanity. In other words, there is a kind of paralysis of becoming concerning reality, because of external circumstance. A revaluation of values would have to include a reassessment of affects. Specific affects, such as a lust, for example, need to be redeemed as valuable for the overall health and growth of the human organism. Others, including those that are a product of resentment and form a sublimation of and release of jealousy, should be revalued as modes of sickness. A necessary part of such a revaluation, though, is to influence the domain of affects – and not just to change our conscious or intellectual view of things. In other words, new values change the way we feel and are incorporated into the body. The Dionysian state as a total stimulation of the affective system, transforming itself through and into all affects.  The great human who can redeem reality does so by immersion, even identification, with it.

Affirmation is a yes-saying in two senses. First, a yes-saying to life, to fate, and to all the suffering or senseless destruction they in fact do and must-have, even those 'beneath' us are necessary for the perfection of the world. This first idea of affirmation is linked to the notions of amor fate and eternal recurrence. Second, affirmation specifies a mode of life the values and actions of which are positive and healthy expressions of that life. That is, values and actions are not derived by or reaction against or even sublimation of other values. These two senses are closely related; indeed, they both describe aspects of an ascending and healthy mode of life. The first concerns the embracing of the whole system of life and one’s responsibility for the development of the human, who is judged evil by both the up and down. This first sense is related to the affirmation of mountains.

A dog is a domesticated, and degraded, beast of prey. Thus, the dog is a crucial analogy for understandingumania, which is associated with periods of decadence. The dog’s famous loyalty is nothing more than submission, and it is thus no more capable of love, but for a different reason, than the cat. This submission is akin to a human’s religious feeling – obedience out of fear, or long discipline. The dog is something that is supposed to be wretched so that its owner can feel important or influential. The sheepdog is an obvious metaphor for those who devote themselves to the protection of the herd. The firedog is noisy, spectacular, but irrelevant – and thus like the socialist revolution and similar events. The critical moments are quiet, creative of values. Zarathustra tells the story of a traveller accidentally stepping on a sleeping dog, making enemies of those who could be friends.

The term dream is used to characterize the Apollonian. The critical distinction here is not between dreaming and being awake; the dream is employed to understand a certain domain of culture, and particularly of art. The dream is a self-created world, one that is created to

 can be a model of free will. Comprehensiveness also describes the various abilities, all separately developed in human prehistory, that needed to come together to make the thinker. Analogously, it either links to the emergence of the comprehensive ‘individual’ who can live ‘beyond’ the morality of some old, decaying culture. The philosopher must be able to see with many eyes, to view things from many perspectives; to develop this ability of  ‘brief habits’—similarly, the ability to function concerning both science and other aspects of culture.

Comprehensiveness is thus a feature of a future philosophical nobility, to be distinguished from the nobility of a narrowly perfected culture, as well as from the anti-culture of the historical sense. This historical sense is a kind of comprehensiveness but without discrimination, without any setting of limits. Such an ideal requires dangerous experiences to enable judgements about the value of modes of life. Greatness is judged in fact by the ability for comprehensiveness. Comprehensiveness thus describes a height that is not that of abstraction and represents an overall responsibility for the development of the human, and which can use a wide variety of cultural forms and institutions as tools. Such responsibility will be able to take on all the hopes and disasters of the past and present, and still rise joyfully to greet the dawn. Thus, comprehensiveness is also related to the ideas of the gift and pregnancy.

When talking about concepts, philosophical concepts or the fundamental concepts of a religion or culture, it refers to, for example, substance, cause, virtue, sin. Any discussion of concepts, therefore, will also be a discussion of philosophy, metaphysics, religion etc. Concepts form a system – that is, individual concepts cannot be isolated but must be understood as a whole way of thinking (and living and evaluating), and likewise studied in their historically developing and repeating interconnection. Philosophical concepts are later and dependent upon the underlying values that produce language. Thus, for example, philosophical concepts are governed or formed upon data that exist as knowledge. Moreover, concepts are not unmediated by or without impact upon life, so long as the data are authentic and not isolated from or even critique of existing values. Thus, the concept of the unchangeability of character is at the root of the idea of clarity. The ‘comprehensiveness’ of terminology’ wants to be able to ‘declare oneself to any other world’ and has ‘no limits’. This cleverness is not dissimilar to ‘no mode of life’ or ‘no’ ideal. Rather, it is determined, determined, and dull. The ability simultaneously and joyfully to distinguish between two or more others is the type of human who can joyfully say ‘that’. That which is innocent is the real thing, and the devil is in the mode of chorus. A similar point is made about even the ‘rabble’. The idea of style is that of uniformity or uniformity of values, but without the strength to do so as effectively. This uniformity is not just a characteristic of the individuals who were involved in the past, nor even in the collective unconscious. It is called ‘opposite ideal’. That is, what are individuals because they are not as thing-like as is thought. Likewise, this opposite ideal’ is a guarantee of possession of the concepts by others, of their independence and their wisdom. Thus, the opposite is also true: all knowledge is the ‘creation of an opposite ideal’.

A traditional definition of consciousness is that part or function of us that not only thinks, feels, and acts but is aware of itself doing so and can reflect upon it. Because of that awareness, consciousness also implies the ability to will its thinking, acting and even to some extent, its feeling. Accordingly, consciousness is the real concern of the way the living are used and abused. Belief in the existence of anything like a god exists as an illegitimate basis on which to live, a danger to the future of the human. Instead, consciousness is the basis of a healthy and authentic pride and realising of the non- existence of something like a god. The song and dance of musical instruments is a great instrument of the mythic role of a god, but the god performs the greatest acts of creativity in the sphere of culture and morality.

The Dionysian is one of the three cultural drives in The Birth of Tragedy, along with the Apollonian and Socratic. The Dionysian is there associated with intoxication, ecstasy (being- outside-of-oneself), and thus with cultural productions such as lyric poetry and many aspects of music (especially harmony).  This artistic drive implicitly has a metaphysics (i.e. a way of understanding the nature of reality). The coming together
