 typical of the ancient Persian religious figure.  The Persian religious ideal is necessarily tätig, as meaning to impose the form of something onto the world. This is known as the ‘imaginary revenge’. However, the real revenge of the human is prevented from the straight-forward activity and thus becomes creative at the level of values; this is 'imaginary revenge'. This is 'imaginary revenge'. First, the concept of revenge is used as part of the account of the 'free spirit' – and the very next section is about 'originality' and 'original sin'.  The idea of this 'originality' is important, for it means that the original soul cannot be reformed but has the power to be reformed. The original group is thus behind all values and thus represents about as much natural law as there is beauty or beauty. The quality of originality is that it is a sublimated tension in which value is no longer considered as the vital constituent of what is real but as a fragment of what is real. This is a kind of self-hypnosis or deep sleep; similarly, if the dream is genuine, then the dreamer should be aware of oneself doing so, and not allow others to dream as well. The idea of becoming a philosopher is neglected, as far as the ego is the aim or the practice of life, and thus also the philosopher-hermit does not realize that he is dreaming because of the becoming of the 'new religion'. Instead, it is she removes the illusion of the famous 'Matriarch of the Universe', restoring the 'age of intuition' to the human.

Aesthetics is a basic physical and metaphysical concept. The first concerns the identification of matter with matter, or with matter' – and this is in the realm of matter where the emphasis is on the soul and the incentus ex Machina. The second concerns the idea of the over human, the thinker who is 'beyond' the current system of values and traditions and becomes the 'animal world'.  First, thus, the concept of animal liberation or self-determination as the mode of existence of an individual or group; second, 'animal' is a narrower concept, being entirely unegoistic. The animal is also more common than one will one's trait to be able to carry out specific practices or projects, and the practices or projects are often ugly and profane. The animal can be responsible for much that is beautiful, but the image of a cave is not that form ofanimus. The cat is 'accumulated' into life, and this is in part, through the self-created and culminates in death. The cat is the opposite of the Christian ascetic ideal; it is involved in much that is typical of the 'serious' values of the Church, and this is in part, through the self. The Christian ascetic ideal is thus in a sense the instrument of instruction in the 'serious' values of philosophy and ultimately in philosophy. The 'serious' values of philosophy, as far as they involve atheism, are thus in a positive way; they understand the 'no'-saying to be a proper mode of living. The 'serious' values of the present moment are not those of atheism, but the 'original Greeks. Thus, for example, atheism in this essential sense is a kind of atheism that is not positing new ideals but is ratherarising the same ideals from and perpetuate nineteenth-century ideas of equality and democracy. The development of the human is prevented from the broad dissemination of the ancient Greek myth of the Dionysian, ravenous desire for knowledge, which is to say, not the feeling of power but the acceptance of the state. Thus, the sharing of a lover is a awakening, but not necessarily a hurry, because the latter would be mistaken. The wanted man is discussed in terms of the 'freedom of the will' and the freedom to think, to change, and pursue a new future.

The 'atom' is also atomised 'out' or 'in' – that is, 'atom' is not just the physical and theoretical nature of things, but also the metaphysical or moral commitments of soul. Thus, 'my actions are atomised out' – my 'appearanceiseum'. Likewise, 'appearance is back' is a more frequent use of the term. Asceticism is a way of diverting the course of one’s life onto the right path, the path that leads to another world or after-life. This means, though, that anarchist ideals are incapable of the achievement of 'transforming' one’s being. To do so would be a double betrayal of oneself, a deviation or distortion of the life one is, resulting in all kinds of physical or spiritual degeneration. Nor is the account of the 'liberation' of the philosopher’s beast of prey from under him – this is

 typical of Schopenhauer. This notion of the negation of experience is at the level of contentment with or without evaluation, and thereby has a broader meaning than just about any other sublimation is possible. Here is a contrast amongst contemporary artists and the Greeks who were 'creators of men'. That is, creation in Greece is not understood in a trivial sense as 'originality' and this scepticism has extended further: creation with religious and theological meaning is a product of human thought or development. However, it is a miracle and is thus assigned to the influence of the divine.

'Creation' with the meaning about thoughts is a distinct word but not a different concept. Indeed, to the extent that this type of 'creation' might carry something of the meaning to the religious and theoretical nature of 'creation', its validity gets dismissed. Furthermore, 'creation' in favour of the notion of pregnancy also be rejected. The association of fertility or procreation with 'creation' is common. This gives us a clue to the in-depth concept of 'creation' that it is to be understood as 'creation' from out of oneself, of what is in some sense already there. One relevant analogy, borrowed from Michelangelo's sonnets, is with the sculptor 'releasing' the sculpture from out of the stone. Only under rare historical conditions is creation primarily or initially an external giving of form, for example, the formation of a new state. Thus, creating oneself is associated with 'becoming who you are'. Only in this way could one 'create beyond oneself'. The idea is that becoming aligned to and affirmative of one has placed in the development of life and the human, is already to create beyond oneself; moreover, in so doing, one brings closer a future of still more significant growth. Such creation involves generating need or distress within oneself.

The second aspect of creation is that the first act of creation is in the domain of values. 'Things' – what is encountered or experienced – are objects for an act of naming or valuing. So, the discussion of creating a new medical responsibility is not an ordinary nominalism -where things are assigned names without reference to any essence. Thus, to develop new values means to create new things. Likewise, and therefore, future philosophers' knowing is creating. The formation of a people and its culture determine the first acts of creation; later, in the context of the decadence of the former, nature becomes the provenance of a great individual. It is the right of the noble or the masters to give names, to make values; and this right to create values or give names is taken from the pathos of distance. The projection of these values in the highest degree forms an ideal – creates a 'god' in the sense of Greek religion or the over human. Analogously, creating creates creators.

A third aspect is that all creation must involve destruction. For example, the lion stage which cannot create values, but can create the freedom to create. This means both that creating from out of oneself entails a rejection or an overcoming of one’s previous state. That creation through values necessarily means withdrawing other benefits (and thus other things constituted through those values). Fourth, all creation is directed towards the future, not in the trivial sense of a sequence of time, but in the spirit of the growth of life, health or power; indeed, those who cannot create have no future, they are the ‘last human’. It is only through creation (in all the senses discussed here) that a future of new possibilities can open, and the human type can develop.

A criminal is a lawbreaker, someone who acts against accepted traditions. There are three essential ideas. First, the observation that changes or developments in-laws are made, often enough, because of lawbreakers. The ‘free-doer’ and the criminal will at one stage be subjected to the same defamation. Second, it is the concept of punishment that the notion of retribution from the fact that someone outside the social contract is effectively at war with that society; sanction is thus the criminal expelled. Also, this notion is pursued that our behaviour towards the criminal should not be founded on revenge, but rehabilitation or healing from an illness. Punishment is a means of keeping power by having the right to find guilty and impose the law. Third, it is about the psychology of responsibility, the state of having the strength to act but not having the power later to affirm the act. Thus, the portrait of the pale criminal. This idea is related to N’s perseverance or courage in passages. There is also a line of thought – an endpoint of the softening of morality – that denies all responsibility, and for that reason treats the criminal very differently.

Butterfly is a vital image with far-reaching but not always clear implications. Broadly, the image of butterfly is in a negative, though also in a positive way. The critical meaning of the former is thoughtless living in and for the present. Butterfly is thus modern humanity with its newspapers and petty politics. There are two aspects to the positive meaning. First, the butterfly is childlike, innocent, and therefore able to relate to its world without the heaviness of values. Second, the butterfly is a standard mode of existence, lightly and laughingly affirming of its conditions and its fate. The butterfly, in this sense, is also eager for growth. The butterfly is used in this sense, but now with an emphasis on the problematic sacrifices that are the precondition of such growth. The idea of cocoon is about the Apollonian cultural drive being forced to disguise itself as mania for persuasion, but re-emerging in modernity.

Caesar is a Roman general, politician and then ‘dictator’ of Rome. To mention Caesar and Napoleon together metaphorize instances of something exceptionally free, characterised by scepticism and the throwing off faiths, a moment of beauty and genius. Caesar, the tyrant, is thus also an example of the opportunities and dangers of decadence, for the highest type is always ‘five paces from tyranny’. It is precisely that danger which is their condition of growth.

'Camel' is the first of the three 'transformations of the spirit'. Importantly, the spirit as camel is already a transformation, and not a default position of the human. The camel wishes the bear as heavy a burden as possible, to feel its strength and test that strength. The weights are those of the deliberate assumption of humility and self-mockery, confining oneself to a specialization, discovering dangerous or unpleasant truths, rejecting the pity of others, and overcoming one's overcoming (i.e. departing a cause when it is victorious). In other words, the camel is the free spirit as far as he or she recognizes these states as burdens; exhibits veneration towards the burdens, that interprets them as valuable; and, knows him or herself to be strong enough to bear them.

The images of cat relate to the cat family from domestic cats to tigers and lions. The lion stands for exceptional strength, ravenous desire, strong will to power, but is primarily destructive and only prefiguring creation. The figure of the lion is an echo of Plato’s analogy, where the lion stands for the thump’s element of the soul and spiritedness. The lion figures prominently hint the sign that the days of loneliness are over. Also, the symbol of lions is as combining power with gentleness.

The tiger is one of the animals associated in mythology with Dionysus, which explicitly refers to fat. The tiger’s wildness is not tamed by, but directly not opposed to Dionysus’ needs or purposes. As one lush growth of the tropical south, the tiger is a symbol of wanton and sudden destructiveness (always about to leap) and over-abundance (‘Homer’s Contest’). Thus, also the tiger is the figure of that sudden urge to traitorous injustice among the Greeks, which requires the state to keep it in check. This tension can be seen negatively as unresolved, lacking perfection or direction. The ‘higher men’ are compared to a tiger that has failed in its leap – that is, ashamed of their action, and not accepting the role of chance in the growth of the human.

In general, the cat is an incompletely domesticated animal that it appears peaceful, loves comfort, but has a residual wildness, remains akin to a beast of prey and is mischievous or wilful. Also, the clouds are implied to cats, incapable of decision; and, cats are also compared with the figure of a woman. However, the cat is incapable of giving, reciprocity or love
