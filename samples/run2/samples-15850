 ideal – to feel at home the sense of being. Analogously, the figure of the noble savage – an oasis for the quieting effects of distance – is an ideal opposite the great human being who can comfort and even calm the waves.

The image of a bridge is conventional that it is an opportunity for overcoming (for growth, development, progress of some type), and it has value for that reason alone. Thus, the human is a bridge and not a goal. Also, the passage called ‘On Redemption’ takes place on a ‘great bridge’. The ascetic ideal is, for a philosophy, a unique bridge to his or her conditions of growth. The priests are scolded for believing that there is ‘but one bridge’ (i.e. a universalising morality and monotheism), and the tyrant believes all history has been a bridge to him. A more complex analogy of a bridge is used to discuss the idea of the Republic of Genius, which is understood as a goal.

Buddhism is an ancient Asian nontheistic religion. Along with Vedanta, it had a significant influence on European thought from the late eighteenth century on, albeit accompanied by several misunderstandings. Schopenhauer finds in the accounts of dukkha (suffering) and the meaninglessness of action support for his pessimism; likewise, in Buddhism, he finds the ‘solution’ to suffering in the renunciation of will. Buddhism is to be praised for its lack of theism and pursuit of the otherworldly, and its freedom from ressentiment. On both these grounds, the historical Jesus is described as a Buddhistic. Nevertheless, it must be judged as a passive nihilistic form of life.

Buildings are represented a whole host of symbols here, involving the construction of, living in, decay or demolition of built structures. Most of these symbols are conventional and not difficult to understand.  Architecture occasionally is in a literal manner. Highlights include the concept about our diminished sense of the symbolic nature of building and architecture as will to power), and the observations about city architecture.

Burckhardt’s historical approach which viewed as potentially necessary all aspects of culture. Burckhardt’s ‘aristocratic’ critique of what called ‘modern ideas’, particularly the commercialization of culture,  the consolidation of political power in an aggressive state and the reduction in the diversity of social strata.

Butterfly is a vital image with far-reaching but not always clear implications. Broadly, the image of butterfly is in a negative, though also in a positive way. The critical meaning of the former is thoughtless living in and for the present. Butterfly is thus modern humanity with its newspapers and petty politics. There are two aspects to the positive meaning. First, the butterfly is childlike, innocent, and therefore able to relate to its world without the heaviness of values. Second, the butterfly is a standard mode of existence, lightly and laughingly affirming of its conditions and its fate. The butterfly, in this sense, is also eager for growth. The butterfly is used in this sense, but now with an emphasis on the problematic sacrifices that are the precondition of such growth. The idea of cocoon is about the Apollonian cultural drive being forced to disguise itself as mania for persuasion, but re-emerging in modernity.

Caesar is a Roman general, politician and then ‘dictator’ of Rome. To mention Caesar and Napoleon together metaphorize instances of something exceptionally free, characterised by scepticism and the throwing off faiths, a moment of beauty and genius. Caesar, the tyrant, is thus also an example of the opportunities and dangers of decadence, for the highest type is always ‘five paces from tyranny’. It is precisely that danger which is their condition of growth.

'Camel' is the first of the three 'transformations of the spirit'. Importantly, the spirit as camel is already a transformation, and not a default position of the human. The camel wishes the bear as heavy a burden as possible, to feel its strength and test that strength. The weights are those of the deliberate assumption of humility and self-mockery, confining oneself to a specialization, discovering dangerous or unpleasant truths, rejecting the pity of others, and overcoming one's overcoming (i.e. departing a cause when it is victorious

Energy is the ability to do work. It is an incredibly common term. Free spirits tend to be relatively weak, by comparison with the energetic focus achieved by the unfree spirit; so, how is it possible for the free spirit to have the energy – to have what might be called ‘strength’ and ‘endurance’? The answers are given in later sections: the struggle against unfavourable conditions or tapping into a cultural reserve of the ‘accumulated energy of will’. Within the social sphere, this notion of ‘accumulated’ energy is essential and is associated with periods of decadence. There is the notion of energy frequently be acclaimed to explore aspects of health or abrupt ability to defend or resist, and the positive aspects of pessimism or nihilism.

In the history of thought, the Enlightenment refers to eighteenth-century European thought, with an emphasis upon the use of a scientifically understood reason to solve political, philosophical, religious, or moral problems, and a judicious scepticism in matters metaphysical.  The banner of Enlightenment ideas was token up, especially to contrast the romanticism and nationalism. To be sure,  Enlightenment is not as a single historical period, but as a broader tendency towards the overcoming of metaphysical and moral constraints. Moreover,  the Enlightenment is naïve about religious metaphysics, and that it had no inner relation to the French Revolution. This manifests itself in the political sphere that Enlightenment political ideals relate to democracy and equality.

Along with Heraclitus, Epicurus is the ancient Greek philosopher. Epicurus took the atomism of Democritus and extended it into an ethical philosophy that had significant influence. The vital idea from Epicurus includes: first, liberation from irrational fears (e.g. of the gods) leading to a sense of tranquillity is the aim of the good life. In its extreme, this is a kind of self-hypnosis or deep sleep; similarly, liberation from desires extends beyond one’s capacity; third, liberation includes the ethical values of friendship and solitude; the last,  the gods are at least uninterested in human affairs, and indeed there is a hint in Epicurus that the gods are projections of human ethical values. In either case, it follows that the cosmos should be contemplated, but without fear, as chaotic and without purposes.

This concept of equal or equality is employed to analyses about strong or weak powers and the political implications of powers in equilibrium. The essential use of equality is in discussing the moral/political notions associated with democracy or class.

Eternal recurrence (or ‘return’) is among the most famous and widely discussed concepts. There are two broad (and not mutually exclusive) ways of interpreting eternal recurrence. Either it is a metaphysical/cosmological claim concerning reality; or it is a test of – or element within – the highest affirmation of life. On the first of these interpretations, the whole of the real exhibits only so many combinations, which are interlinked and follow in a definite order. Thus, in infinite time, the real must repeat itself in a vast ‘year’. On each cycle, the same entities and events occur.  

The second interpretation is more important, not least because, on its own, the first is irrelevant to human values or behaviours. To affirm eternal recurrence means to exist in such a way as to celebrate eternal recurrence as if it were a cosmological truth, to want its truth. Only that form of life that has (i) overcome nihilism, (ii) also overcome the temptation of pity for higher types that are incapable of further development, (iii) overcome nausea likewise at the thought of the periods of history dominated by ressentiment or degeneration, and (iv)  loves its fate  (the notion of amor fati), would be able to affirm the eternal recurrence of all things. Nihilism must be overcome because the affirmation of eternal recurrence is an assigning of value, but imminent one, rather than founded upon some origin or telos (end or purpose).  Pity must be overcome because to will eternal recurrence is also to will

 ideal idea, which involves an elaboration of the metaphor of (i.e. the concepts are interlinked) may mean that they are an elaboration of a broader idea of how knowledge is possible in the first place. Or, alternately, the idea of the need to protect cultural asset Universities are in a constant state of war with themselvesTF when confronted with a competing idea of how life works or should live. The cloud is also a tool for Michelangelo's famous cave model. He would paint a portrait of the murloc cave as representing the pinnacle of art – and thus also as symbolising the reduction of the human to a metaphysical mechanical pattern. This is a case of a butterfly being led to show apparent truth. If Michelangelo's portrait is any portrayal of the human, it is not the case that the portrait is figurative; the portrait is genuinely human. So, how does the portrait look like, and how does the portrait be able to communicate that idea of the beauty of the beauty to the rider? The idea is that a snake is a metaphor for pushing, and the image of the serpent as a test of that. The image of the serpent is about the capacity for mass, and the lack of a sexual drive present in modernity. In a culture of communication, the serpent is the one pushing the rules, and the masses are then transformed.

The serpent is said to be dancing in front of a empty concert hall. The marketplace is ‘a cruel, amoral world’, and the indications here are based on and not the place of art or philosophy. There are two aspects to the idea. First, the beautiful god as seeker after for all types of employment and employment opportunities, and her as receptacle for those kinds of discoveries that are ‘unworthy of discovery’. Second, the philosopher must be able to’s intellectual bridge too – to reveal self-overcoming. This is a period of great promise and need, but which prosperity is hidden from us by art or philosophy – that is, the pathos of distance.

The concept of mythic symbols represents a step up from Zeus' art metaphor to Hera’s Titan (the sky) and thus a possible element in the development of the god of healing. Alternatively, using the ancient Greek concept of cosmic brightness, which is a system of figures and symbols that span many cosmic types, including those associated with the human and animal, and which are tools for symbolic representation within the new life.

The primary condition of communication is the sharing of a language – a system of signs and significations that are not revealed to the least individual. But what is said and written are not words but aural signs or values, values that appear as faces on a scale, and not as expressed values, but values that are expressed as thoughts. A common theme through all this sharing is the idea of the ‘energicizing effect’, which is a mechanism by which the devaluing and diminishing of others can give rise to new values. This effect is both physiologically and spiritually catalyzed.

As a metaphor, the feeling of cosmic calm is achieved by masking the agonistic reality of modernity; by masking the contempt for nature that is the’s only hope of peace and prosperity; by masking the harmful effects of class; by pretending to be different, incorporating the effects of cultural change into their propagandistic narrative; and, ultimately, by pretending to have different things to offer all humanity. This fake, one’s compared that which is genuine with the ‘small’, simplified and simplified. Here, mind#$ is an allegory involving symbolic inversion, in which the actual is used to represent the superior or actual. This is a case of ‘thinking well is a great expression of character’, and giving the impression of privilege. The idea is that by giving the impression of a fixed cultural pattern, but by allowing for years of stagnation, an illusion of future benefits. Contrast with the noble conceit that thinking is a test of self- will. Thinking is intelligent that which is said to be good, and which has no purpose in the record. The latter is effectively the going-no’s of the successful test physicist.
