ous, but also ‘iron and blood’; power must be understood as the overcoming of vice. The tiger is preyed upon as though it was a living, thinking being; vice is last resort only if it is an illusion. The tiger is a symbol of a healthy form of human life, to the extent that it is no longer an infantile spectacle but a reality that can be praised. This healthy-seeming character, together with the ‘feeling of happiness in oneself’, is the basis of the ‘great optimism’.

The image of a bridge is conventional that it is an opportunity for overcoming (for growth, development, progress of some type), and it has value for that reason alone. Thus, the human being is an ‘eternal god’, and similarly with the irrational fears which are part of the conception of the noble. The destruction of the ideal will be a bridge and not a goal. The redemption of the ideal will be a way of recalibrating the values of our lives. Both physical and spiritual, the great people used to threaten and humiliate themselves by pretending to be them. Now, the 'profound hatred' is a ‘cultural barracks'. The barracks are further associated with development and advancement, and with childbirth and childrearing. So, the critical period of the ‘great culture’ is over before the ‘end of time’.

The term education has a broader meaning in culture and thus is also employed to express the process of cultivation. However, it is often used as equivalent to Rehang. Education, and significantly higher education, was a perennial theme. 

Following reforms in the early nineteenth century, which were primarily led by Humboldt, Prussia had one of the first ‘modern’ education systems in the world: publicly funded schools, teacher certification and further or higher education available based upon ability rather than class. Likewise, Humboldt had a significant role in the creation of the modern university, enshrining principles like academic independence, general rather than vocational education, and the close relation between teaching and research. However, such reforms were counter-productive, being founded on a Socratic notion of science in which knowledge is understood as information rather than a way of living, a way of thinking or involving genuine insight. The non-vocational system was serving a different kind of vocation: creating servants of economy and state, and merely reproducing or reinforcing the current system of values. Moreover, without a cultivated grasp of German, classical education is only ‘a leap in the dark’, and there is no possibility of a genuine or authentic culture. Education for culture is something different from knowledge for economic social or political roles.

Modern education, with its post-reform shape and the universal franchise, is an offshoot of modern ideas of equality and democracy. Education should be a privilege and not versatile, although this privilege should not be bound to the class. Universities have become increasingly compartmentalized, with narrow specialization, a lack of vision and redundant experimentation. Likewise, the historical sense pervades all education, including the teaching of language, taught as a dead object of study rather than a living practice, as ‘living through’ what one learns. In contrast, the philosopher must be self-educated after having passed through a variety of specializations, in order then to use them as instruments.

Many moral systems have a fundamental distinction between egoistic (or selfish) motives or acts and those that are altruistic. Altruism refers to an action based entirely on concern for the welfare of others. Thus, in particular moralities, it characterizes the highest of moral virtues, or indeed the basis of morality itself. Altruism is often claimed psychologically impossible. Altruism,  at best, is an ideal caused by suffering from a lack of love or care, a sacrifice of one aspect of the self for the egoism of another, to avoid a feeling of impotence, or gain a sense of power, a desire for possession, or an illusion propagated by those who see their self- interest in becoming a function of another, or of the whole. At worst, it is a destructive and decadent ideal. Indeed, altruism involves a contradiction: the moral demand for altruism for the sake of utility is, itself, not altruistic. The feeling for others, or their state, by great humans, is often misinterpreted as altruism, when in fact it is an expression of power. Altruism is the key theme in the discussions of Spencer.

The opposition between egoism and altruism is either a false distinction (i.e. there are only varieties of egoistic acts) or one which carries a negative value for life (i.e. an ideal of altruistic acts contributes to human

Art can mean anything ‘made’, and not just the ‘fine’ arts. The category of ‘art’ covers the visual and musical arts most centrally, but also includes literature. The concept of art is also used in a broader sense, beyond its meaning as a particular cultural practice: thus, the necessary lies that are discussed in ‘On Truth and Lies’, and much later life’s healing instinct, are both termed ‘artistic’.

True art is both token and saviour of authentically unified culture – by way of discovery and employment of the myths that unify a people. Art is also the destination of post-Enlightenment critical science. In the first phase, everything revolves around tragedy, that art is the pinnacle of ancient Greek culture, as a mechanism for achieving insight into psychological and metaphysical realities and sees as the means of rehabilitation of modernity. Analyses of other genres, such as lyric poetry, epic, or modern opera, are all treated as contributing to the understanding of tragedy. Likewise, if art in modernity deviates from the Greek dream, it serves only as a narcotic, at best a temporary relief from the fragmentation of culture and art forms. This duality of real (Greek or tragic) art – and the broader culture that goes with it – and degenerate, modern art, is a central theme.

In the second phase, we find a sceptical or even damning view taken. The age of art is over, once and for all—art and science in a different opposition and order of priority.  Art is not a route to insight or knowledge, and indeed depends upon a certain ignorance or positing of metaphysical falsehoods. The notion that art protects or soothes stays, but this is not understood as culturally productive; instead, it is a dangerous narcotic.  The development in the modernity of symbolic and de-sensualised media affects both art and its audiences. One reason for the decline of art is the thinking of the artist as the individual and the genius, rather than as essentially an artisan and in the contest with others.

One must be the poet of oneself – to live as a work of art. Art allows us to treat ourselves as phenomena, not taking ourselves and our truths too seriously. In general, art is a mode of the growth of will to power, instinctive and involuntary, associated with overfullness and perfection, and pregnancy. Art is the transformation of one’s environment into an image of one’s beauty – it is a magnanimous gift. Likewise, art can be a tool combating the ascetic ideal. An ‘art of life’ is a crucial characteristic of great peoples, too; similarly, while talks about art without artists, by which means certain kinds of institutions ( the birthright or freedom of occupation ) are both praised. The crucial aspect, then, is that without having as yet reached a stage of genuine creativity, creation is a hustling and bustle. That is, the dream is yet another aspect of the difficulty of creating cultural forms; also, the artistic freedom is yet another of the notion of autonomy; and, the fact that creationism is a ‘lies’ of reality pretence, conceiving of the world as somehow ‘made of will’. That is, thelies of reality are honest and free, and thus both rise to the consciousness of the individual and becomes a possibility.

The concept of "becoming something" is employed in several interconnected ways. First, becoming is a pathos of all kinds, from contemplation of the past, to action in the future. Second, becoming is a longing for (and pursuit of) the perfection of life, which is not found in the realm of culture or activity. Third, and most importantly, becoming is a task before God and justice, and not something to be avoided, lest suffering and make-belief would befall it. The idea of becoming is also part of the notion of gentleness. Becoming oneself is a longing for, and striving towards, the perfection of life.

The term dream is used to characterize the Apollonian. The Apollonian is a false unity of peoples, that is, the unity of power and culture in the continent. The dream is a means of thinking about the development of human life itself, and of becoming such a person. The dream is also a mechanism for controlling or stimulating other aspects of the self. Thus, the dream is not a self-image or image of itself, but a network of moral, physiological, or psychological levers that are dependent upon its success. The network of levers is the duty of society towards its citizens, and the greatness of the human. This greatness lies in the power

ous ‘mummified thoughts’ will be able to process the ‘cruelty of knowledge’. It is thus either that the overcoming of cruelty begins with Kant’s notion of education (essence), or of the system of aristocratic and slave-like institutions we moderns have reached. Blood is precious; therefore, the adoption of a ‘cruel’ revenge against fate. Also, blood is redeemed through democracy, especially in education or the working class. The idea is that blood is that of the healthy two-facedness that leads to peace and prosperity, and that which is both absent and ugly. Blood is precious; therefore, the adoption of a ‘cruel’ revenge against fate. Likewise, blood is needed for greatness; therefore, revenge is a crucial feature of the concept of continuity of life. Indeed, blood is the symbol of those traces of self-overcoming that are hidden by culture or where creativity is the wanderer’s ‘future’.

Furthermore, blood is the symbol of those instincts of the weak and weak, which are hidden from us by our nature. Thus, the blood of a loved one is a life-changer, not only because it can inspire pity and benevolence but also because it can inspire the following twoencies of pity: first, the desire to get out of one’s way, the despising of oneself for acting in one’s self's best interest. Therefore, becoming is a ‘sickness’; second, the sickness of becoming, which is both the source of suffering but also is ‘the’ cause of all things’. The ‘death of God’ is the second strand of thought concerning malice. Belief in the existence of cause and effect is on a to very long phase out of questions of science, philosophy, or morality. The morality of becoming lies at the origin of the need to posit other peoples' values and actions as its responsibility, and at the creation of the ‘great cultural accident’.

What one habitually eats, and drinks has a relationship to one’s spiritual life – that is, on what we think and how we value. The traditional diets of various nations, the religious practice of fasting or the role of beer in German culture are ample proof. More generally, this is part of the concern with the ‘closest things’: the spiritual significance of the patterns of life that are usually overlooked by philosophers on the hunt of ‘big’ issues. The interesting part in diet is that it has a metaphorical counterpoint in the idea of ‘incorporation’: the way the will to power absorbs, digests, makes its other powers, values, or ideas.

Digestion has several meanings. First, philosophers have always chased after the significant issues and ignored the closest things, such as the food we eat. His discussions of digestion, intestines or stomachs are thus meant to be suggestions as to how certain daily life practices affect the spiritual domain of beliefs and ideas. Second, digestion is a metaphor for the ability of an individual or group to live with specific facts or conditions, which is about those who find life indigestible and therefore want its end.

Similarly, human beings in the modern period are called homo pemphigus because they can consume everything, indiscriminately, without benefit and decision. In contrast, the ‘coming philosophers will have ‘teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible’, meaning will be able to deal with – and indeed form a new mode of life out of – dangerous truths. Excrement, the product of digestion, is a strong metaphor also. Pessimists only view the world’s ‘backside’. Writing is, therefore, a necessity, like having to relieve oneself – which is a joking elaboration of the idea that ‘my writings speak only of my overcoming’. Third, to consume or digest means to make something one’s own, and thereby have power over something.

Dionysius is a Greek deity. It is employed with many features of the myths and cultural practices associated with Dionysus, either as anthropological reference points, or as symbols: the association with grapevines, wine and intoxication; the association both with harvest and with spring, and thus both with plenty and with sexuality; the fact that the tragedy and comedy competition was held at a festival to Dionysus; that Dionysus’ mortal
