 seriously; namely, the 'Dream' is a symbol of a healthy and honest pride. The 'new philosophers', they insist, are to be found outside of his or her protective sphere, while the latter urges him towards his denigration. An historical sense of the 'new philosophers' is Alexanderanderings or 'original ideas'. Thus, the philosopher who flees the imaginary images in the cave (Apollonian and Dionysian).

Dance is defined as a display of strength and agility, but one that is graceful, as if only a sign of still further reserves of strength and agility, which the description could also be of the noble. The ancient Greeks lived dancelike in this sense; dialogue in Sophocles has this character. Dance thus serves as an analogy for Dionysian insight apprehended calmly in an Apollonian vision; for the overcoming of shame in the healthy and beautiful body; likewise, for the conception of freedom of will as self-determination, taking leave of certainty and dancing beside the abyss – this notion should recall the tight rope ‘dancer’; and generally as the ideal of philosophy, which needs to be able to work with both science and art, accomplished in both but constrained by neither, even though this means an absolute inevitable scientific ignorance. German philosophers got criticised, for whom thinking is nothing like dancing, struggling without a ‘finger for nuance’. Wagner is found – and implicitly criticised – for moving music away from dance and its ideal of self-possession even amidst emotional enthusiasm.

Zarathustra walks like a dancer, a sign of the self-overcoming during his long sojourn in the mountains. ‘The Dance Song’ is explicitly there to advocate against the ‘spirit of gravity’, the enemy of anyone who would seek to overcome such burdens. In accord with this conception of dance, we have the famous lines ‘one must have chaos within one still to give birth to a dancing star’, and ‘I would only believe in a God who knew how to dance’. To the latter is contrasted the discontented God who created an ‘eternally imperfect’ world – that is a world characterised by illusion, suffering and dependence. Such a god suffers and, in revenge, wants to make suffering. The dancing god, on the other hand, is Dionysus. Both are projections of human ideals, but the latter is of a healthy form of human life and one aligned to the nature of life as will to power.

The idea of danger is employed in several interconnected ways. First, the danger is the ‘mother of morality’. That is, moral systems and other forms of values arise to fix in place a working social arrangement, one that offers security to the chief concern of the chief, and which then produces a ‘role’ – a simplified version of themselves as the great human is yet again the subject of’ discussion. The vital idea here is that a historical account of the formation of cultural forms and the development of the concept of life in modernity. Second, those factors that are a specific danger to the development of a philosopher (specialization, intellectual conscience, or the need to revalue those values assigned to live). For an earlier example, see also the ‘three dangers’ that confronted Schopenhauer. Similarly, there is the danger attached to philosophical knowledge itself. That is, if absolute falsehoods or simplifications are a condition of life, then bringing these into question will be a danger both to the questioner and to existing forms of human life. Accordingly, the passage to the ‘over human’ will be a ‘dangerous across’, and Zarathustra praises the tight-rope walker for making ‘danger your vocation’. The image of the tight-rope walker brings us to the fourth meaning: danger as a duty.  Therefore, we should live dangerously, risking and having to lose ourselves and our current way of life. Regarding Zarathustra’s inability to express the idea of eternal recurrence, his conscience reproaches him ‘What do you matter? Speak your word and break!’. More generally, Zarathustra talks about courage and the seeking out of dangers as the main characteristic of the growth of the human.

Daybreak is a subtle move away from the ‘positivism’ of Human, All Too Human. The book begins by returning to the origin of morality, though with a modified model that has more emphasis on evaluation and the drives as origins, and custom as mechanism. There is an extended discussion of early Christianity in this light. It then turns to contemporary moral practices and social institutions (marriage, education, etc.). By the end of the book, it offers exhortations to

 seriously with unspiritualised senses. As living beings, we form a social order of drives, all characterized by the will to power. Moreover, the notion of will here (the soul is something more than just a sense of power or power) is no less mistaken. Therefore, there are neither egoistic nor unegoistic acts.

Ralph Waldo Emerson was an influential American essayist and poet of the mid-nineteenth century. Emerson has a conception of the human relation to nature that is different from Schopenhauer, involving alignment to or identification with nature, and including a definite spiritual element: ‘The happiest man is he who learns from nature the lesson of worship’. Emerson, in his description of the solitary and exceptional human who believes in his own thought, also gives an element in the concept of nobility or the over human. Also, Emerson’s notion of which includes the analysis of will and motive, the critique of consciousness as the core of human identity, the nature and importance of solitude, friendship, and the oversoul, is equal to parts Neoplatonic and Vedanta.

Empiricism is a type of epistemology that traces all knowledge back to data of the senses. Although the notion has strong roots in the ancient world, it is significantly associated with the British tradition of Locke and Hume and French positivism in the nineteenth century. Nietzsche is an empiricist, complete with a scepticism akin to Hume's. However, there is also a robust neo-Kantian influence. Much of his epistemological analyses concern the cognitive processes that mediate or distort the data of the senses, and the interpretative 'errors' – most of which have moral values underpinning them – that make knowledge possible. In other words, on Nietzsche's account, there is no unmediated or straightforward access to the data of the senses, as would be needed in a traditional empiricist epistemology.

Energy is the ability to do work. It is an incredibly common term. Free spirits tend to be relatively weak, by comparison with the energetic focus achieved by the unfree spirit; so, how is it possible for the free spirit to have the energy – to have what might be called ‘strength’ and ‘endurance’? The answers are given in later sections: the struggle against unfavourable conditions or tapping into a cultural reserve of the ‘accumulated energy of will’. Within the social sphere, this notion of ‘accumulated’ energy is essential and is associated with periods of decadence. There is the notion of energy frequently be acclaimed to explore aspects of health or abrupt ability to defend or resist, and the positive aspects of pessimism or nihilism.

In the history of thought, the Enlightenment refers to eighteenth-century European thought, with an emphasis upon the use of a scientifically understood reason to solve political, philosophical, religious, or moral problems, and a judicious scepticism in matters metaphysical.  The banner of Enlightenment ideas was token up, especially to contrast the romanticism and nationalism. To be sure,  Enlightenment is not as a single historical period, but as a broader tendency towards the overcoming of metaphysical and moral constraints. Moreover,  the Enlightenment is naïve about religious metaphysics, and that it had no inner relation to the French Revolution. This manifests itself in the political sphere that Enlightenment political ideals relate to democracy and equality.

Along with Heraclitus, Epicurus is the ancient Greek philosopher. Epicurus took the atomism of Democritus and extended it into an ethical philosophy that had significant influence. The vital idea from Epicurus includes: first, liberation from irrational fears (e.g. of the gods) leading to a sense of tranquillity is the aim of the good life. In its extreme, this is a kind of self-hypnosis or deep sleep; similarly, liberation from desires extends beyond one’s capacity; third, liberation includes the ethical values of friendship and solitude; the last,  the gods are at least uninterested in human affairs, and indeed there is a hint in Epicurus that the gods are projections of human ethical values. In either case, it follows that the cosmos should be contemplated, but without fear, as chaotic and without purposes.

Epigone means that someone who believes that all great striving or achievement is behind him or her. This is a feeling about our contemporaries, victims of the historical sense.

Many moral systems have a fundamental distinction between egoistic (or selfish) motives or acts and those that are altruistic. Altruism refers to an action based entirely on concern for the welfare of others. Thus, in particular moralities, it characterizes the highest of moral virtues, or indeed the basis of morality itself. Altruism is often claimed psychologically impossible. Altruism,  at best, is an ideal caused by suffering from a lack of love or care, a sacrifice of one aspect of the self for the egoism of another, to avoid a feeling of impotence, or gain a sense of power, a desire for possession, or an illusion propagated by those who see their self- interest in becoming a function of another, or of the whole. At worst, it is a destructive and decadent ideal. Indeed, altruism involves a contradiction: the moral demand for altruism for the sake of utility is, itself, not altruistic. The feeling for others, or their state, by great humans, is often misinterpreted as altruism, when in fact it is an expression of power. Altruism is the key theme in the discussions of Spencer.

The opposition between egoism and altruism is either a false distinction (i.e. there are only varieties of egoistic acts) or one which carries a negative value for life (i.e. an ideal of altruistic acts contributes to human weakness or degeneration). The removal of the distinction leads to a ‘revaluation’ of egoism. The value of selfishness is measured by the value of the self, depending upon whether individuals are the ascending or the descending line of life. There are, in other words, many types of selfishness or egoism which are ‘despicable’ (the ‘phantom’ ego); it is selfish to consider one’s own judgement a universal law, the ‘tidal waves of selfishness’ found in absolute ages, and likewise greed or lust (in unspiritualised senses). On the other hand, selfishness that is noble or aligned to life is a chief virtue, and the ground of much that one might want to call good: for example, love and friendship, magnanimity, likewise courage and trust.

Two complications should be added, however, to the above discussion. The first is that by selfishness in many such contexts means that selfishness is an extended sense of self. For example, as far as the free spirit has comprehensive responsibility for the human future, this future is an extension of his or herself. The persuasive model for this is pregnancy – a mother’s love and care for the offspring as an extension of her selfishness. Similarly, future philosophers will understand that their ‘destiny’ is everything, and thus ‘what do I matter?’. The second is that a conception of the ego is multiple; the simplicity or unity of the ego is yet another of the metaphysical or moral errors. As living beings, we form a social order of drives, all characterized by the will to power. Moreover, the notion of will here (the ego wills actions in its interest) is no less mistaken. Therefore, there are neither egoistic nor unegoistic acts.
