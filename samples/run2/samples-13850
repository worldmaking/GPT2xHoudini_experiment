The images of cat relate to the cat family from domestic cats to tigers and lions. The lion stands for exceptional strength, ravenous desire, strong will to power, but is primarily destructive and only prefiguring creation. The figure of the lion is an echo of Plato’s analogy, where the lion stands for the thump’s element of the soul and spiritedness. The lion figures prominently hint the clue to the nightmarish events of The Silen Path and The Silen Road Companion. The eagle is the figure of the eagle变有, which was used in Japanese as the ‘immanent’ image of the human, and is also used in a similar manner in Chinese. The cat is also used in this connection in ‘To be sure, cats are still cats at best; and, cats are still the devil's bodyguard until the end of time. But then, by the power of the cat, death will be brought to an end; and, by the courage of the cat, the enemy of the great man is victorious.

The notion of ‘category’ has a long history of philosophy, beginning with Aristotle. In Kant, the categories form a set of 12 essential and a priori concepts under which all experience falls. They thus describe the structure of experience and its limits but also supply a transcendental account of how knowledge is possible in the first place.

Causality is one of the critical physical and metaphysical lines of thought. There are several aspects. Although using some of the same concepts as ‘On Truth and Lies’useful as a kind of shorthand for describing and predicting, the concepts of cause and effect require us to posit the cause and the effect as separable and identifiable; that is, each must be a stable entity. In truth, a continuum faces us, and every causal event is an infinite number of processes. Cause and effect thus offer no real understanding or explanation. This simplifying treatment of cause and effect is founded upon a natural, but mistaken, analysis of will – our clear willing and effecting becomes a model for natural processes. Cause and effect do not follow ‘laws. This notion of natural law as something that ‘governs’ also is an illegitimate application of our (mistaken) notion of willing according to a maxim. The critique of causality also amounts to an evaluation of mechanical thought (all nature consists of pushing and pulling entities). Natural causality is replaced by the concept of a network of forces – that is with the will to power. Among other things, this new concept demands (as against mechanism) ‘action at a distance’. Importantly,  this concept of cause and effect includes a diagnosis of the psychological needs that might explain its adoption.

Second, there are some natural processes at work that are gestured towards by the concept of cause and effect. This whole natural realm contrasts with an unnatural or anti-natural sense of cause and effect: the idea of a sin against God, ‘spiritual causality’, or the cause of itself that is both an account of God but also a model of free will. In all these cases, a cause is posited that lies outside the natural order.

The third strand of thought concerning causality is the notion of sublimation, in which a force or desire has its ‘direction’ changed – that is, its mode of discharge – by a second force or passion. There, the distinction between a vast quantum of power, and a smaller trigger, serves to give the former direction. The latter would be the ends we set ourselves for tasks or our lives. But these are often ‘beautifying pretexts’ – the real function of the discharge is hidden from us.

There are many caves in Greek mythology. The first one is the Dikeman Cave where the infant Zeus was born and hidden away from his father Chronos (time); the second one is the cave near Mount Kylene where Maia gave birth to Hermes (god of travel and herald of the gods), son of Zeus; the third one is the cave near Mount Nysa where Dionysus (another son of Zeus) was raised by nymphs,  hidden from Hera’s jealousy.

The other primary classical source for the image of the cave is Plato. In The Republic, Plato uses the ‘allegory of the cave’

 the truth. Likewise, only in dance can we say the same thing. In truth, though, there is deception. More importantly, the time of the philosopher has accumulated wisdom coming to an agreement with time, and the advisor to insight (the epigonedoro). This dispersion is a crucial feature of the notion of causality and anticipates the next two sections for a relation of power and of desire between and among humans.

The notion of despising is also used as part of the commentary on The Birth of Tragedy. This despising of the ‘art of battle’ continues even after the battle is lost. This reiterates a previous idea, this lack of knowledge of and for the formation of any political or social order, that battles are waged against harmful characteristics. Any attempt to trivialize or trivialize a significant aspect of a battle, this is an attempt to make enemies. Similarly, those who are called ‘great’ are ill because they do not understand the great. In sum,  ‘the real star is not in the battles, but in the trivialism of the enemy.

As often, the purpose of as much writing as much commentary is to critique, therefore neither writing nor commentary belong to any place. Instead, what is considered to be written is that is journalistic 'telling' what is already written to be 'speaking'. Indeed, as far as being commentary isosuke's turn of phrase, we must read as 'telling' the editor that what is written is what is reported. Writing sits squarely with this 'thinking' and is thus often called 'speaking'. 

Similarly,  what is written as deed are available for living ' as those who are written to do 'receive'. Moreover,  what is written as blood is available as 'eternal life' – that is, the 'legends of Dionysus and the Tragedy’.

The for 'industry' is a three-fold class system: first, the 'aristocratic' school, where the 'australianization' of industry from above leads to a 'decadence' beneath the earth. This Third Enlightenment has a goal of 'doctoring' Wagner's tragedy into a ‘heavy work’. Second, there are 'metaphysical' schools, one that values feeling as the core of all experience, and one that values articulation as the constituent parts of knowledge. Here, the apparatus of science is a tube (‘theory’) that carries out its observations but is also a 'metaphysical' school that values understanding the nature of matter and waves. The discipline of botany is a 'slaveburg' that does not understand the metaphysics of vibration and therefore can’s be understood as the mechanism by which culture forms and how culture forms. Third, there is the 'philosophical' school, which tries to understand the mechanism by which culture forms. From these together, 'metaphysics' learns a ‘role’ as the system by which culture forms. The primary function of metaphysics then is to understand the mechanism by which culture forms itself. The function of theory is to discover weaknesses in the system, and from these a ‘new kind of scholar' can appear. The system is understood as the mechanism by which culture forms itself, and from which the positive virtues can be developed. The good of the system is not understood as universal, but as a devising and deepening of the human who is meant to develop these systems.

The notion of democracy is inclusive, as any mode of thought that ascribes homogeneity or uniformity to the real. In political thought, therefore, democracy involves the passing of power to the masses and conceptions such as equality of rights or moral value. The political conceptions of democracy parallel the accounts of herd morality and democracy. Therefore, the concept of democracy, at least act as a provisional instrument for stability and the overcoming of militarized nationalism. Following its in-deep idea, a ‘future democracy’ is characterized by independence of opinion, and modes of life and employment. This future form is distinguished from current forms, such as parliamentarians. The democratic ideal is also considered as that which breaks up rigid class hierarchies. It thus liberates individual ambition, although at the cost of a collective and enduring sense of the future, of the executive power of the group, and productive differences. Democracy produces a people incapable of command and is in danger of falling prey to a tyrant.

Importantly, though, that first broad definition of democracy means that it influences non-political domains. The democracy of concepts whereby modernity considers anyone as ill who

 the spirit of pity will feel the distress of the weak. The distance between the spiritual and moral sense of selfishness and selfishness – the distinction between and ‘between’ two abyss’ – is symbolic not of a free place for pride, but a danger to the development of the human. The cave is the depths of insight or wisdom recognised as the path to power, and the cave should be able to take those forms of the face that are ‘above’ us.

Cialdini’s sound figure by Ernst Chaldini is a scientific demonstration of using the patterns formed by sand on a vibrating plate to visualize resonance. This is as representing a translation from vibration to image, but metaphorically an interpretation that is in no way obvious. and thus, does not allow us quickly to reverse the conversion back to the vibration.

The notion of chance is not, as one might have expected, primarily in the context of a discussion of physics or metaphysics. In these contexts, the much more common problem is the relationship between law, calculability, and necessity. The concept of chance reveals a vital ambiguity. On the one hand, history broadly and the life of an individual are subject to chance, meaning that there is no visible or comprehensible necessity and no repetition of events. Moreover, existence is characterized by chance in a grander sense: without overall or original purpose or meaning. Thus, even necessity has a chance-like character to it, since that necessity is not willed. Where its highest values are concerned, human cognition cannot accept chance; thus, the simplifying operation of cognition makes such chance appear as necessity and subjection to natural law, or as purpose or will. This simplification has moral consequences: the great idea of the innocence of chance is found at D13 in the context of a discussion of punishment. So, for example, simple mistakes are counted as crimes against God or justice, while the happy accident which is a great human being is accounted evil. Indeed, even the origin of those mental functions by which we think necessity (knowledge, reason, logic) lies in chance, that is in some fortunate event of prehistory in which a useful new characteristic or technique was stumbled upon. Likewise, the relationship between a genuine culture and the philosopher: without such a culture, the philosopher is a chance appearance like a ‘comet’. Moreover, without that culture – that is to say, in most times and places – the great human is crushed by chance, and this tempts one to pity. Nevertheless, love and gratitude towards such chance are needed.

On the other hand, there is a necessity (or a fate) at work in cultural production, particularly art and philosophy. Here, the chance is defined against some underlying necessity, one that may be a willed achievement. For example, the rhetoric of the New Testament is not an ‘accident’ but is an intensification of a characteristic of the Jewish people. Again, the advent of Wagner could not be chance. Especially in the sphere of culture, greatness means allowing an underlying necessity, rather than incidental chances or irrelevant details, to guide one’s hand.

Similarly, what is chance is fragmentary, aimless, or stunted; the response of health to this is a synthetic, compositional activity, making whole out of what is an only chance, and giving it a goal. The one with a long and unbroken will has the strength to will into the future, whatever may chance to interfere. The human must be liberated from chance as from priests; that is, freed from either a pessimistic assessment of human possibilities, from the endless diversion of the random and incidental, or from the rule of chance in human evolution.

Chaos is a significant ancient concept. The earth is ‘formless and empty’ before God’s creation. Similar ideas are common in other accounts of nature, such as Hesiod for whom Chaos was the first primordial deity. Eighteenth and nineteenth-century anthropology discovered that this myth pattern often took the form of a struggle against Chaos, which was often represented by a serpent or dragon (e.g. Zeus’ battle with Typhon). The notion of Chaos is on its own; scientific knowledge is a destruction of human nature and descent to Chaos. One of the meanings of the ‘evil’ principle is ‘chaos’. However, the struggle against the dragon is a struggle against a fixed order, and for Chaos. Thus, one must have chaos within one still, to give birth to a dancing star. Here, Chaos is not the enemy of but the principle of creation.

Chaos is an essential character of the real, but the real has no intrinsic order. Thus, there has also no meaning, purpose, wisdom, or beauty. Some claims to have liberated things from their
