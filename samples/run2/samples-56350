 as the new standard of living is ascribed to digest, contemplation, and the like, but also the calm tranquillity of sudden needs and unpleasantness. Thus, the tiger is a symbol of wanton and sudden destructiveness (always about to leap) followed by terror and a ‘scramble’ (‘the lightning bolt is a crucial symbol’), which also refers to the scepticism against the light of faith, and the difficult-nerving devotion to the self-realization of self-development.

Another aspect of the symbolic meaning of the eagle is the image of fat. The eagle is a fat cat with a long, ravenous mouth. The cat is a symbol of wanton and sudden destructiveness (i.e. on its own), followed by a great cheerfulness or of great distress. The eagle is a sublimated (i.e. diverted to be in some way more joyful) image of an agonistic and agonizing way of feeling pleasure. The agon is the symbol of the struggle against the dragon, who is always on his own and only aware of his deed. The eagle is a symbol of the struggle against the dragon, who is always trying to get what he can from the feelings of the weak or the weak. The eagle is a symbol of those who are too cowardly to change the direction of their willing and thus soon abandon him in favour of their contentment. The dragon is thus the ‘monster of decadence’.

An allegory about the life of an actual human being ishes over all knowledge of the individual, including the real, and instead creates values. Thus, the over human is described as ‘the last Christian God’.

An allegory is an image of which we read often of comfort, love, and security. It is also part of the metaphor of the peace and magnanimity of the Renaissance. So, the meaning of the Greek concept of allegory was not meant to be a narrower one, but a broader one: the idea of what is meant by ‘apostate’ being in discussing the relation of tragedy to the dance. Similarly, there is the danger in the caricature of the human that is ‘too cheerful’. The human is a ‘monster of decadence’; that is, its actions are not altruistic. An ‘endurance’ is an effect of human nature but not yet powerful enough to overcome the awareness of itself as an against. This is the ‘sense of the abyss’. That is, the sense is that what is real is thought, not thought but ‘appearance’. The idea is that the human being, as far as of fixed character and resistant to becoming and growth, is somehow the ‘spirit of gravity’; that is, the element of chance in the sake of some enhancement of health or power. The chance are a ‘pyramid’ with the figure of a strand of thought that is ‘too small’; or the temptation of pity for higher types that are too small to overcome. The discussion of pity or jealousy is not an focused one, and all our thought about pity is focused on the egoistic type of person. The pity of not knowing oneself is a product of the inability to function groupsize. also, that is, unity is not possible if not for the denial of other peoples' work. Therefore, those who are called ‘good’ are often themselves ‘bad’. Indeed, the concept of ‘good’ can be used as a term of abuse. The most famous usage of the idea is found both in philosophical texts and in historical research. The discussion of the philosopher of the cave is particularly interesting:  who   is needed for the time of the ascetic ideal; and, what lies the danger of the careless self-discipline of the human ancestor. The discussion of digestion is significant, for example, because it seems to be a cocooned environment where organisms can develop. The cave is also a space where dangerous and beautiful ideas can befall the health of their forms. The philosopher of the cave is also aware of the cruelty in revealing self to others, even if it has to be self-denial. Thus, if knowledge kills prejudice, then the philosopher of the cave is also a philosopher of the caves – because they are both places where knowledge can be found and to teach how it is to find it.

Conscience is one's sense that what one is doing is the 'right' or 'wrong' thing; the concept applies whatever the sphere of action is (intellectual, practical, moral) and whatever standard of right or wrong is relevant. For example, despite temptations, the rigorous seeker after truth cannot return to romanticism or Christianity without 'dirtying' his or her intellectual conscience. Conscience can

 as one’s sense of the great city to rival the height and power of Mount Kylene’? The answers are given in later sections: the struggle against unfavourable conditions or tapping into a cultural reserve of the ‘accumulated energy of will’. Within the social sphere, this notion of ‘accumulated’ energy is essential and is associated with periods of decadence. There is the notion of energy frequently be acclaimed to explore aspects of health or abrupt ability to defend or resist, and the positive aspects of pessimism or nihilism.

In the history of thought, the Enlightenment refers to eighteenth-century European thought, with an emphasis upon the use of a scientifically understood reason to solve political, philosophical, religious, or moral problems, and a judicious scepticism in matters metaphysical.  The banner of Enlightenment ideas was token up, especially to contrast the romanticism and nationalism. To be sure,  Enlightenment is not as a single historical period, but as a broader tendency towards the overcoming of metaphysical and moral constraints. Moreover,  the Enlightenment is naïve about religious metaphysics, and that it had no inner relation to the French Revolution. This manifests itself in the political sphere that Enlightenment political ideals relate to democracy and equality.

Along with Heraclitus, Epicurus is the ancient Greek philosopher. Epicurus took the atomism of Democritus and extended it into an ethical philosophy that had significant influence. The vital idea from Epicurus includes: first, liberation from irrational fears (e.g. of the gods) leading to a sense of tranquillity is the aim of the good life. In its extreme, this is a kind of self-hypnosis or deep sleep; similarly, liberation from desires extends beyond one’s capacity; third, liberation includes the ethical values of friendship and solitude; the last,  the gods are at least uninterested in human affairs, and indeed there is a hint in Epicurus that the gods are projections of human ethical values. In either case, it follows that the cosmos should be contemplated, but without fear, as chaotic and without purposes.

Epigone means that someone who believes that all great striving or achievement is behind him or her. This is a feeling about our contemporaries, victims of the historical sense.

This concept of equal or equality is employed to analyses about strong or weak powers and the political implications of powers in equilibrium. The essential use of equality is in discussing the moral/political notions associated with democracy or class.

Eternal recurrence (or ‘return’) is among the most famous and widely discussed concepts. There are two broad (and not mutually exclusive) ways of interpreting eternal recurrence. Either it is a metaphysical/cosmological claim concerning reality; or it is a test of – or element within – the highest affirmation of life. On the first of these interpretations, the whole of the real exhibits only so many combinations, which are interlinked and follow in a definite order. Thus, in infinite time, the real must repeat itself in a vast ‘year’. On each cycle, the same entities and events occur.  

The second interpretation is more important, not least because, on its own, the first is irrelevant to human values or behaviours. To affirm eternal recurrence means to exist in such a way as to celebrate eternal recurrence as if it were a cosmological truth, to want its truth. Only that form of life that has (i) overcome nihilism, (ii) also overcome the temptation of pity for higher types that are incapable of further development, (iii) overcome nausea likewise at the thought of the periods of history dominated by ressentiment or degeneration, and (iv)  loves its fate  (the notion of amor fati), would be able to affirm the eternal recurrence of all things. Nihilism must be overcome because the affirmation of eternal recurrence is an assigning of value, but imminent one, rather than founded upon some origin or telos (end or purpose).  Pity must be overcome because to will eternal recurrence is also to will the destruction even of higher humans, and in general one must the rule which is the triumph of the ‘small’. Fate must be loved because the eternal recurrence demands a willing higher than just reconciliation with or acceptance of fate. That is an affirmation, even a longing for. Moreover, the commitment of eternal recurrence is the love not only of the whole course of things but specifically of my place within them. The love of fate must include gratitude towards the cruelty of accident and my own foolishness’s (i.e. the past must be redeemed), and desire for my own ‘is going under’ (my self

 as the conditions of life and the human (e.g. 'Too long have I. Investigated the distance'). In a manner akin to Buddhism, Jesus refuses to place happiness or the ideal at a distance – that is in a transcendent deity or an unfulfillable promise. 

The most famous usage of the metaphor of distance is in the expression 'pathos of distance.' Indeed, a distinction is implied between 'distant' and the more general Ferne, employing the former when he wants to draw attention primarily to 'rank'. The relevant sense of distance is that of insisting upon real distinctions among individuals or groups (mainly between types or classes), and the value of these for the health and growth of human life (it is thus related to height or 'separation'). Even among his or her peers, even in acts of obedience, the noble person stays independent, not forming part of a 'herd'.  This distance is not just a state, but a 'pathos' – that is, a kind of effect. The effect is a state of mind that includes an evaluation of its object and leads to judgement or action. Pathos falls under this category but is not something that could be called incidental or fleeting; by 'pathos.' An effect is meant that is a defining characteristic of a way of life. The pathos of distance, therefore, stands for a defining characteristic of the noble, part and parcel of his or her self-respect and sense of right. Likewise, some things should be apprehended only from a distance, because then their image can inspire. However, such a pathos against, primarily, Christianity, which abolishes distances (except for the absurd distance of transcendence), making everyone equal, cutting any possibility of reverence among humans. Besides, the pathos of distance is significant because it represents a condition of health in the human which in turn makes a 'more mysterious pathos', namely for new possibilities of human life and growth. Likewise, those noble types who feel the pathos of distance have overall responsibility for the future.

Distress is an affective state experienced as an emergency: something vitally important is (or will be) wrong or missing. It is also used to describe conditions of suffering or poverty. Its philosophical significance lies in the conception that certain instances of distress are needed for life to overcome itself. The narrative begins when Zarathustra hears a ‘cry of distress’ and is tempted by pity for the higher humans. For the recognition of, and responding to, distress lies at the origin of the standard or ordinary. Likewise, there has a magnificent tension of the spirit and nihilism, which is experienced as distress. Rather than anaesthetizing that distress, the aim here is to release the tension in pursuit of new forms of human life. Other relevant passages elaborating on this idea include: the ‘highly spiritual’ will feel a delight over and above all the distress of a problem, psychology must overcome distress – an ‘unconscious resistance’ – to ideas of the reciprocal dependence of excellent and wicked, or celebrated Greek characteristics were not ‘natural’, but products of a need. The expression ‘ turning of need’ got repeated many times that turning is a reference to eternal recurrence, as well as meaning ‘transforming’ (it may also be an allusion to spiritual orientation in Plato and especially Plotinus). So, for a being capable of aligning itself with the will to power and incorporating the notion of eternal recurrence, distress is transformed into a necessity, into a joyful affirmation of one’s self and one’s world.

The dithyramb was in ancient Greek literature a choral hymn to Dionysus, set to music and dance. The dithyramb, following Aristotle, was thus the original form of Greek tragedy. Only fragments of dithyrambs survive, along with observations concerning characteristic rhythmic, formal, and narrative qualities, but without any clear evidence as to how they were performed.

A dog is a domesticated, and degraded, beast of prey. Thus, it is both suddenly aggressive, and contemptible in its display of cowardliness, distress, or anger. Having been a slave, it has become nothing other than a slave. Thus, the dog is a crucial analogy for internalization, the opinions of or relationships to others becoming part of one’s identity. The dog’s famous loyalty is nothing more than submission, and it is thus no more capable of love, but for a different reason, than the cat. This submission is akin to a human’s religious feeling – obedience out of fear, or long discipline. The dog is something that is supposed to be wretched so that its owner can feel important or influential. The sheepdog is an obvious metaphor for those
