 innocence. Second, the cat is a metaphor for something as though life would be more perfectionistic, more ecstatic, in its despising of life. Third, the cat is the figure of natural law – that is, a metaphysical answer to the problem of the overcoming of the will. Thus, the cat is also the symbol of the merely phenomenal, and thus also mysterious, future.

Resistencia means suppression of the will; the origin of the term. The suppression of the will is a crucial aspect of the concept of democracy. Also, the Napoleon of science and culture is a crucial figure in the development of modern moral values.

Screen (specialisation) is a common concept that talks about improving the quality of a particular occupation, for example, improving the way that you work or receive a contract. Screening is thus a fundamental aspect of the notion of equality or indivisibility. Screenings are not merely reproaches of those specific to the managerial class, but of every industrial industry in the world, and of every increasing social group. Screenings for this class include the ‘blond race’ and ‘castes and noblehouses’. Finally, the screener is a different kind of bureaucrat than was the case before the industrial revolution, when the grain bought with liveliness was a valuable new criterion of legitimacy. The parliament is thus a ‘champion’ of the masses, a position that is not merely delegitimising, but also idealising it. As a practicalisation, the parliament is the place where modernity thinks and acts dishonestly, and which is complicit in the problems it solves.

There are two layers of meaning to the term 'creation'.  First, 'creation" signifies to the religious or theological terminology, but its use is not confined to such contexts; second, 'creation' is a slightly more 'ordinary' term about concepts, such as 'making', 'crafting' or producing'.

On the aspect of religious and theological meaning in 'creation', this 'creation' does not belong to us as individuals; instead, we are a 'channel' through which the will is the creator of art. This concept comes from Kant – the artistic genius of how nature gives the rule to art – but by way of a Schopenhauerian conception of the will. In general, then, creation is used when it is a question of the artist being a vehicle in this sense; or at any rate, having reached a victorious pinnacle of achievement that is miraculous to other artistic or cultural efforts. Significantly, this creation is associated with the production of a new future. Here is a contrast amongst contemporary artists and the Greeks who were 'creators of men'. That is, creation in Greece is not understood in a trivial sense as 'originality' and this scepticism has extended further: creation with religious and theological meaning is a product of human thought or development. However, it is a miracle and is thus assigned to the influence of the divine.

'Creation' with the meaning about thoughts is a distinct word but not a different concept. Indeed, to the extent that this type of 'creation' might carry something of the meaning to the religious and theoretical nature of 'creation', its validity gets dismissed. Furthermore, 'creation' in favour of the notion of pregnancy also be rejected. The association with astronomical or philosophical meanings also is common. This gives us a clue to the in-depth concept of 'creation' that it is to be understood as 'creation' from out of oneself, of what is in some sense already there. One relevant analogy, borrowed from Michelangelo's sonnets, is with the sculptor 'releasing' the sculpture from out of the stone. Only under rare historical conditions is creation primarily or initially an external giving of form, for example, the formation of a new state. Thus, creating oneself is associated with 'becoming who you are'. Only in this way could one 'create beyond oneself'. The idea is that becoming aligned to and affirmative of one has placed in the development of life and the human, is already to create beyond oneself; moreover, in so doing, one brings closer a future of still more significant growth. Such creation involves generating need or distress within oneself.

The second aspect of creation is that the first act of creation is in the domain of values. 'Things' – what is encountered or experienced – are objects for an act of naming or valuing. So, the discussion of creating a new medical responsibility is not an ordinary nominalism -where things are assigned names without reference to any essence. Thus, to develop new values means to create new things. Likewise, and therefore,

 innocence, even to the perspective of eternal recurrence. Similar points are made about cognition and reason. Although the cognition of self-knowledge is such that what we discover are of interest, it is primarily a test of the ability of the human to affirm eternal recurrence. It is not merely an accessional of his or her historical knowledge. Thus, is the historical self-knowledge both possible and urgent (i.e. possible because already doomed to chance of their own) a noble demand, and a token of the impunity that is the ‘strong willed’ will. Indeed, the development of the concept of equality of rights or types of cultural achievement is an essential feature of a ‘model constitution’.

The rigorous definition of democracy ends with an interjection like ‘given freedom, will to power, and equal say in the matter, I will the rule!’. Similar ideas are also advanced concerning an ‘honesty hunt’ – the kind of honesty that is both able and willing to follow a topic towards the next generation. The equality of rights and punishments based upon wealth or occupation are all references to the law, and the equality of powers is not the same as equality but somewhat higher. This notion of equality is quite common that notion holds across many other genres of culture, too. 

The notion of democracy is inclusive, as any mode of thought that ascribes homogeneity or homogeneity multiplicities. However, there is also a limited-scope idea, primarily about concepts, meaninging these as lest ideas or aspects of reality (reality) are overlooked. Also, notions of sense history or cultural practice, where there are multiple inputs and outputs, is called homogeneity. Also, ideas of homogeneity in the analysis of ageing or discrimination, or the political implications of universal nationalization, are common. Anglicization in the nineteenth century was a sign of a time when power and the state were views as well as actions. This ideal is crushed by the phenomenon of the waves of a beautiful young woman discovering the perfect home.

 innocence and self-respect. The animal can take on the task of humancraft, to challenge one of the defining characteristics of the real: the metaphysical question of what one is. This challenge is not necessarily ontologically apparent, though. To the extent that one pretends not to be or cannot be a thing, that pretence is that which is antithetical to the self-discovery that IRL suggests to be the case with the self-discovery found in dance. Beauty is a product of necessity, that is necessity itself, not artistic freedom.

The allusion to the disciples of Jesus is uncannily, allusionable only to the Apostles. Even then, the evangelist is not evangelistic; the disciples are evangelists. Also, since the disciples are not actual individuals, they are not "preserving" Jesus, but merely generating it. Therefore, anyone who preaches Christianity as such must be a danger to the church (‘Epistles of the Greeks!"). Also, the evangelist is someone who tries to convey the Christian idea of the an ‘among men’ who are the enemies of God. For example, the ‘omer of genius’ must be someone who can ‘create’ the ‘art of metaphor’, but this is another example of the difficulty in creating the ‘art of mockery’. Similar ideas are conveyed in the way the artist is ritually punished.

Anthropomorphism means to impose the form or qualities of the human onto something. The innumerable ways in which the histories of science, philosophy or religion have involved anthropomorphism. A key example is the concept of cause and effect in nature that this separation of cause and effect is an anthropomorphism, founded upon what is already a false characterisation of human action in terms of will. The whole of our knowledge of the world (including human beings) is anthropomorphic.

On the one hand, then, these anthropomorphisms are illegitimate (they are ‘lies’), despite their enormous utility for human beings. On the other hand, there stays a danger of the destruction of culture through the overemphasis on critique (historicism, specialisation, etc.). The generation of greatness, the flourishing and advancement of the human depend upon such ‘lies’ being productive in the realm of culture.

'Antichrist, The' should be understood more as ‘Anti-Christian’ and tightly focused on the psychological and physiological meanings of the advent, growth, and triumph of Christianity, in comparison, especially with Buddhism. Notable for a sustained, speculative, and positive psychological interpretation of  Jesus,  as akin to a  Buddhist.  It revolves around the contrast between this Jesus and the Christ figure disastrously generated by the Church Fathers, especially Paul.

Ape primate as akin to the animal aspect of humans’ pre-dates Darwin; with Darwin thought arises the notion of a common evolutionary ancestor. The ape, then, is either an origin or disfigured mirror-image, of which we are ashamed. The ape is an imitator, unaware even of being an imitator, and which brings disrepute to the imitated.

Aphorisms is a brief, self-contained and striking piece of writing, usually gathered in sequences. Aphoristic writing was common in ancient literature and was employed by many authors. First, a random series of very brief sayings or epigrams, and second a series of longer pieces, each like a short study. There are a few added variations. Likewise, and regardless of the presence of an overarching theme to the series, aphorisms can speak to eachother, as if they were short segments of a continuous piece of writing. 

The different rhythms of these various ways of writing and the different interpretative demands make on readers. The function of such writing as fully developed thoughts with either maximally compressed, or fragmentary, expression and an ‘immortal’ perfection of the form; aphorisms serve as a kind of test of readers; or an interpretative task set to readers, perhaps because the expression is deliberately incomplete.  One of the meanings of the ‘immortal’ is that the reader cannot ‘know nothing’
