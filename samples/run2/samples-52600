creation of character. This idea of having a need and having an overflowing of creative overflowing, to say the least. The idea is that the human is a bridge and not a goal. Also, the image of a bridge is not just a visual one, but also a projection of human will towards the higher humanity. Thus, the human bridge is a metaphor for the power of naïve appearance and decadence, which for religious systems led to the conclusion that there is a spiritual equivalent in the belief that disasters are behind them. In his later work, the ‘nightmare of appearance’, he devises a ‘deification of the humanis reality’ to become a mask. This function is not dissimilar to the beauty of the over human. However, it is still not the ‘greatest thing’.

The literal meaning of the term 'economy' in Greek is 'household'. Economy is one of the most frequent concepts used to describe the interrelated, systematic nature of life (or, for example, the soul). It is suitable as far as both are dynamic and relational. That is, for example, an economy must involve both those who buy and sell; analogously, the system of life will have to apply both active and passive, weak and intense moments of will to power.

The term education has a broader meaning in culture and thus is also employed to express the process of cultivation. However, it is often used as equivalent to Rehang. Education, and significantly higher education, was a perennial theme. 

Following reforms in the early nineteenth century, which were primarily led by Humboldt, Prussia had one of the first ‘modern’ education systems in the world: publicly funded schools, teacher certification and further or higher education available based upon ability rather than class. Likewise, Humboldt had a significant role in the creation of the modern university, enshrining principles like academic independence, general rather than vocational education, and the close relation between teaching and research. However, such reforms were counter-productive, being founded on a Socratic notion of science in which knowledge is understood as information rather than a way of living, a way of thinking or involving genuine insight. The non-vocational system was serving a different kind of vocation: creating servants of economy and state, and merely reproducing or reinforcing the current system of values. Moreover, without a cultivated grasp of German, classical education is only ‘a leap in the dark’, and there is no possibility of a genuine or authentic culture. Education for culture is something different from knowledge for economic social or political roles.

Modern education, with its post-reform shape and the universal franchise, is an offshoot of modern ideas of equality and democracy. Education should be a privilege and not versatile, although this privilege should not be bound to the class. Universities have become increasingly compartmentalized, with narrow specialization, a lack of vision and redundant experimentation. Likewise, the historical sense pervades all education, including the teaching of language, taught as a dead object of study rather than a living practice, as ‘living through’ what one learns. In contrast, the philosopher must be self-educated after having passed through a variety of specializations, in order then to use them as instruments.

Many moral systems have a fundamental distinction between egoistic (or selfish) motives or acts and those that are altruistic. Altruism refers to an action based entirely on concern for the welfare of others. Thus, in particular moralities, it characterizes the highest of moral virtues, or indeed the basis of morality itself. Altruism is often claimed psychologically impossible. Altruism,  at best, is an ideal caused by suffering from a lack of love or care, a sacrifice of one aspect of the self for the egoism of another, to avoid a feeling of impotence, or gain a sense of power, a desire for possession, or an illusion propagated by those who see their self- interest in becoming a function of another, or of the whole. At worst, it is a destructive and decadent ideal. Indeed, altruism involves a contradiction: the moral demand for altruism for the sake of utility is, itself, not altruistic. The feeling for others, or their state, by great humans, is often misinterpreted as altruism, when in fact it is an expression of power. Altruism is the key theme in the discussions of Spencer.

The opposition between egoism and altruism is either a false distinction (i.e. there are only varieties of egoistic acts) or one which carries a negative value for life (i.e. an ideal of altruistic acts contributes to human weakness or degeneration). The removal of the distinction leads to a ‘revaluation’ of egoism. The value

Anthropomorphism means to impose the form or qualities of the human onto something. The innumerable ways in which the histories of science, philosophy or religion have involved anthropomorphism. A key example is the concept of cause and effect in nature that this separation of cause and effect is an anthropomorphism, founded upon what is already a false characterisation of human action in terms of will. The whole of our knowledge of the world (including human beings) is anthropomorphic.

On the one hand, then, these anthropomorphisms are illegitimate (they are ‘lies’), despite their enormous utility for human beings. On the other hand, there stays a danger of the destruction of culture through the overemphasis on critique (historicism, specialisation, etc.). The generation of greatness, the flourishing and advancement of the human depend upon such ‘lies’ being productive in the realm of culture.

It revolves around the contrast between this Jesus and the Christ figure disastrously generated by the Church Fathers, especially Paul.

The ape, then, is either an origin or disfigured mirror-image, of which we are ashamed. The ape is an imitator, unaware even of being an imitator, and which brings disrepute to the imitated.

Aphorisms is a brief, self-contained and striking piece of writing, usually gathered in sequences. Aphoristic writing was common in ancient literature and was employed by many authors. First, a random series of very brief sayings or epigrams, and second a series of longer pieces, each like a short study. There are a few added variations. Likewise, and regardless of the presence of an overarching theme to the series, aphorisms can speak to each other, as if they were short segments of a continuous piece of writing. 

The different rhythms of these various ways of writing and the different interpretative demands make on readers. The function of such writing as fully developed thoughts with either maximally compressed, or fragmentary, expression and an ‘immortal’ perfection of the form; aphorisms serve as a kind of test of readers; or an interpretative task set to readers, perhaps because the expression is deliberately incomplete.

Apollonian is named after the Greek God Apollo; this is one of three drives that it is a key to understanding cultural production and cultural change, from the ancient  Greek world on. The other two are Dionysian and Socratic. A  brief period in which the Apollonian and Dionysian work together produces ancient tragedy. The Apollonian is the origin of those cultural forms where beauty and clarity of form are emphasised (examples would be epic poetry, architecture, and sculpture), and the effects of calm or cheerfulness. Apollonian implicitly carries with it a metaphysical view concerning reality, that is, the belief that individual entities are ontologically original. Importantly, though, the Apollonian is also characterised by an awareness that these valued forms are an illusion to a Dionysian view of existence (a dream in which we are aware we are dreaming). Thus, the Apollonian should not be understood as a kind of self-deception or turning away from the real (that would be more akin to the Socratic). In his later work, the Apollonian is no longer thought of as a competing, brother drive to the Dionysian, but

creation, the formation of a new state is an integral part of the concept of duty. Therefore, the ideal of the duty of saint is effectively answered with the concept of duty. The duty of saint, understood as renunciation, is the notion of the impossibility of becoming whole and capable of being what you are. Here are three ways: first, that ideal in the first sense is foreign to Kant; it is also foreign to early modernity. Second, the French and Germanobergism of the concept of innocence or innocence that is not positive, but has a defining characteristic of modernity; this potent combination makes modernity certainties. The dream, in turn, branched out into the awareness of one's true self and one's purpose in life. Moreover, the concept of Dionysian can also be considered through this fashion. This ‘inspired’ state is thus key to the noble attempt to communicate to and transform others. However, the free spirit sometimes needs to avoid communication even to his or her closest friends, either to protect the self and its ideals or them.

However, such reforms were counter-productive, being founded on a Socratic Socratici. The key figures here are Marx and Engels. For liberalism, the necessary reforms were the turning in the mid-nineteenth century to the development of the intellectual and moral precondition of a ‘dwarf’. Waking life is the domain in which ‘modern’ thought begins and will continue to evolve, and thus also should continue to evolve. This does not mean that the realm of possibility is homogeneous; instead, it is the situation that allows the god Dionysus to appear to humanity. The ‘Dionysian’ is the realm of which atheism is an ‘accident’ – that is, a conceptualisation of existence that does not involve fatal doubts about the genuinely real values behind the events of creation and follow-on observation. The purpose of comfort is to allow observation and to enable religious faith to be posited as the mechanism for understanding the nature of reality. The Dionysian is the realm of knowledge where unbelief is a problem of a wilful ignorance – not the ‘foolish’ side of the traveller. The over human as cosmic policeman is done – done – by becoming aware of oneself doing wrong and taking revenge on others. Being conscious shows intellectual conscience. Waking life is the domain in which ‘modern’ thought begins and continues, and which is elevated on the ‘great temptation’. Waking life is the domain in which ‘modern’ thought begins and continues, and which is elevated on the ‘great temptation’ of decadence. Waking life is the domain in which ‘modern’ practices like diet, daily routines, religion etc. all but destroy it. This is the ‘cruel and playful’ way of waking life.

The notion of culture has a broader meaning than is often thought. It is about the various processes of culture that are often unaware their cause, but that is then confronted with a reward or consequence. This is like the ‘gathering gloom of the religious-moral pathos’.

The concept of culture also has influence on the notion of ‘modern’ or ‘iron and granite limits’. The former relates in part, but not fully, by saying that society begins with no ignorance of history, or of the development of dialectic in philosophy and ultimately of logic. Education, on the other hand, begins with the ‘preachers of the future’, and continues throughout his or her existence
