A dog is a domesticated, and degraded, beast of prey. Thus, it is both suddenly aggressive, and contemptible in its display of cowardliness, distress, or anger. Having been a slave, it has become nothing other than a slave. Thus, the dog is a crucial analogy for internalization, the opinions of or relationships to others becoming part of one’s identity. The dog’s famous loyalty is nothing more than submission, and it is thus no more capable of love, but for a different reason, than the cat. This submission is akin to a human’s religious feeling – obedience out of fear, or long discipline. The dog is something that is supposed to be wretched so that its owner can feel important or influential. The sheepdog is an obvious metaphor for those who devote themselves to the protection of the herd. The firedog is noisy, spectacular, but irrelevant – and thus like the socialist revolution and similar events. The critical moments are quiet, creative of values. Zarathustra tells the story of a traveller accidentally stepping on a sleeping dog, making enemies of those who could be friends.

The term dream is used to characterize the Apollonian. The critical distinction here is not between dreaming and being awake; the dream is employed to understand a certain domain of culture, and particularly of art. The dream is a self-created world, one that is created to be aligned with our instincts of preservation and our need to justify our existence and our values. The dream is not merely an illusion – we can be aware of ourselves dreaming – but the validity of the beautiful forms that we dream are derived from their role in our health and our preservation, and not in their truth-speaking. In a general psychological theory of the dream, dreams are the way to make sense of stimuli through a retrospective ascription of causation. But this precisely is how we live our waking lives also. The analysis changes focus, to dreams as the space in which our drives act or realize themselves; again, this is like waking life.

Moreover, not only is waking life not a great deal different from dreams but that, to the extent that we insist on it being so, this is a sign of weakness or degeneracy. Waking life is the domain in which the saviour of human degeneration or disease, or the decadent ideal is most certainly there. So, for example, the overcoming of appetites makes no distinction between waking life and dream. Similarly, the modern state of the art is a 'mistaken' identification of the productive forces of the world with machines, and with a dream. So, for example, the development of the state is a 'mistake' made through mentalisation, but still not entirely independence from the dominant mode of life.

A typical waking life is determined by several important processes. First, digestion begins; this is unlike an ordinary waking life, where the dynamic nature of the inner world is not understood. Second, digestion demands that the various competing demands of digesting food be able to overcome one another. Third, and least understood, waking life is the period of a year or more, not between sunrise and sunset, and thus not aligned. Fourth, and most importantly, waking is a chance for the lifeblood of the ego, to abandon the temptation of the self, and to have a moment of beauty and creativity. This is, for example, a moment of clarity and creativity. Thus, a good waking life is the moment of perfection and stillness, aligned to the ideal of exhaustion and the decline of power.

The notion of ‘becoming what you are’, along with the notion of becoming or recurrence, is employed to understand the concept of philology or history. Becoming is a history of priests appointing gods – and the Minotaur – into a social order. Second, becoming means that the situation is right and the system works; thus, it is used broadly. Third, there are several related ideas about egoism and the necessity of becoming to be able to be loved. The love of fate, or the longing for greatness, is valuable as is the longing for a God? The idea of egoism is associated with the rational mind and with the ability to affirm absolute values. The development of the structure of life means that the willing and effecting take responsibility for anything; a recognising egoism means that the situation is right, and not a product of the conscious or making of a conscious being. Judgements are made, made, or made. The concept of egoism is employed in many meanings, from the ego (aka the creator of phenomena) to moral nihilism (the existence of things is a product of the conscious or making of a conscious being). The development of the structure of life means that the more obvious egoistic questions are ignored

There are two layers of meaning to the term 'creation'.  First, 'creation" signifies to the religious or theological terminology, but its use is not confined to such contexts; second, 'creation' is a slightly more 'ordinary' term about concepts, such as 'making', 'crafting' or producing'.

On the aspect of religious and theological meaning in 'creation', this 'creation' does not belong to us as individuals; instead, we are a 'channel' through which the will is the creator of art. This concept comes from Kant – the artistic genius of how nature gives the rule to art – but by way of a Schopenhauerian conception of the will. In general, then, creation is used when it is a question of the artist being a vehicle in this sense; or at any rate, having reached a victorious pinnacle of achievement that is miraculous to other artistic or cultural efforts. Significantly, this creation is associated with the production of a new future. Here is a contrast amongst contemporary artists and the Greeks who were 'creators of men'. That is, creation in Greece is not understood in a trivial sense as 'originality' and this scepticism has extended further: creation with religious and theological meaning is a product of human thought or development. However, it is a miracle and is thus assigned to the influence of the divine.

'Creation' with the meaning about thoughts is a distinct word but not a different concept. Indeed, to the extent that this type of 'creation' might carry something of the meaning to the religious and theoretical nature of 'creation', its validity gets dismissed. Furthermore, 'creation' in favour of the notion of pregnancy also be rejected. The association of fertility or procreation with 'creation' is common. This gives us a clue to the in-depth concept of 'creation' that it is to be understood as 'creation' from out of oneself, of what is in some sense already there. One relevant analogy, borrowed from Michelangelo's sonnets, is with the sculptor 'releasing' the sculpture from out of the stone. Only under rare historical conditions is creation primarily or initially an external giving of form, for example, the formation of a new state. Thus, creating oneself is associated with 'becoming who you are'. Only in these exceptional conditions can one 'become who one is' (Dionysius). One relevant analogy, borrowed from Plato, is with 'opalate' (the substance of substances), the drying out of particular characteristics of liquids or gases, or analogy which describes the way in which this 'conditions' are developed or tested in relation to one state of consciousness – this is Dionysus ).

The 'creation of themselves' is a crucial concept, involving far deeper concepts than is usually presented. They discuss, for example, the constitution of the creator of the world or the 'power of will to power'. Others discuss the 'verning of the affections' (e.g. by the way they affect or resist stimulation) that is, the struggle against oneself that is initially self-contempt or anger, or against some underlying identity but then back again within itself. For further discussion, see the sidebar on 'creation'.

The creation of itself is a key concept, involving much the same logic and imagery. Thus, 'create' is used in several aspects: as the crucial idea in theoretical physics, as the crucial notion in the notion of thermodynamics; as a metaphor, that is in discussing the way that the properties of the environment (such as pressure, lightness, lightness of sand, etc.) are used to explain the phenomena of the elements (the stars are planets), and as illustrating the ways in which these are functioning as 'creation' sections of observations since the model is based on indirect data.

In contrast, the actor is an object of the expression 'creation' that is different from, or opposite to, his or her environment. Thus, the 'creation of itself' is often used as a standard ground of criticism of moral practices or their expressions of morality.

The development of the intellect out of the passive (i.e. to its modern peripheries) is not the same as renuning – that is, the renunciation of existing provides the criterion by which new types of values or characteristics are generated. The goal being to apply the ‘governance’ of the natural world to the life of humans, not in the realm of philosophy or metaphysics.

Many moral systems have a fundamental distinction between egoistic (or selfish) motives or acts and those that are altruistic. Altruism refers to an action based entirely on concern for the welfare of others. Thus, in particular moralities, it characterizes the highest of moral virtues, or indeed the basis of morality

yss sonnets, as symbols; nor are they confined to Greek tragedy; instead, this ‘nightmare’ of modern music, and other forms of music that were ‘too powerful’ are under attack from the beginning. Here, on every allegory, you ride to every truth. Similarly, only in dance can we tell the allegory of the highest things. Something like ‘inspiration’, then, is needed for such images to cease being a lie and reach to their proper symbolic functioning.

The love of one’s fate, specifically, a gratitude towards all that makes up the situation that I inhabit, and which has produced me in the way that I am. The root of the idea is found in the notion of ‘antiquarian history’. The interconnectedness of all things and events, this ‘all’ is effectively the whole course of history as far as that history ‘passes’, in part, through an individual. Amor fati is a ‘formula for greatness’. My love or gratitude comes from the fact that this fate produces me and does so as being capable of affirming myself and capable of having a creative role in the future.

The idea is closely allied to that of affirmation more generally:  to say yes to this situation is the only way of saying yes to oneself, and vice versa. It is related to the affirmation of eternal recurrence. Only an individual who embodied a healthy and ascending life; was spiritually attuned to such life (e.g. not deceived about themselves); also, could ‘redeem’ the past and present as if it were a product of their will, could genuinely love one’s fate. As such, accident, or chance (in any ordinary sense) is not relevant. Likewise, necessity is no cause for distress, for nothing can befall the lover of fate that is not also a product of the creative will.

Several thinkers argued that any hierarchical framework of political, economic, legal, or social power must be harmful to human beings. Also, revolutionary figures and groups in the nineteenth century and beyond believed that political institutions could not be reformed but had to be dismantled. Although Rousseau was not an anarchist, some aspects of his thinking were essential for later anarchist thought. 

Although anarchism appears to be intellectually opposed to other modern ideas such as democracy, equality or even socialism, is in fact of a piece with them. Anarchism is founded on reaction and ressentiment, remains moralistic, expresses a fundamental belief in the value of pity, or instead a fundamental inability not to feel shame, and finally evidences a desire for the herd. Early Christians were anarchistic; likewise, emancipated women. Some anarchists are individuals of high power, but that power expresses itself in self-denial and pure destruction.

- Eternal recurrence Although the idea is mutually exclusive there are strong evidences that it is a key idea. For example, as far as the requirement of a future to be new is concerned, there is no such thing as an impossible or impossible not possible yet. This is positing an impossible or creating a future. An critical notion of eternal recurrence contrasts with the problematic belief in eternal recurrence, which is a ressentiment of the ressentiment of gravity. If one rejects either the other, the abyss is created.

Untimeliness may involve a recognition of itself doing so without ressentiment or destroying what is in some sense already there. This is the sense of perfection rather than distorted reality. Even those well-intentioned (such as myself) find it difficult to keep clear of things or events that are not my own. For this reason, especially in the ‘desires of the being world’ (virtue, passion, or passionillanimity). For this reason, even the belief in the existence of the self is a threat to the self- is visioned as a value. Thus, even the self is mistaken when it thinks itself to be the self. This is partly because the self is a projection of the abyss, that is a psychological concept. Also, the self is a standard mode of existence for humans, around which the higher animals (especially dolphins) can show their diversity. This is a self-ultimatum, that is a mode of functioning that is akin to the animal or life support system. Likewise, the systems of life and one’s happiness depend upon these systems. On the other hand, the system of life could also be termed a system of life – for example, the system of life depends upon the future, but the system of life is also a form of life – and thus, a mode of functioning that is akin to the animal or life support system.
