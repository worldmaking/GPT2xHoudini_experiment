The same point is made about even the ‘rabble’. The highest form of life would be one that has the strength to remain devoted to the ascending movement of life, regardless of conditions. The theory of the all-determining effects of milieu (a sociological theme essential to the accounts of culture and language) would be able to appreciate this as something akin to the accumulation of power; indeed, the feeling of superiority can be experienced. The theory of the all-determining effects of milieu (a historical account of the development of language) would be able to appreciate the multiplicity of motives and actions that are always present in oneself and which are never fundamentally changed. It would involve both a revaluation of the value of knowledge and a reassessment of the attitude towards human beings necessary for human growth and which depends upon human life and growth.

Similarly, the period of philosophical development in which the development of character is often cited as an relevant period. For, what is significant is not objectively existing feelings of distress, or existing knowledgeless in its intent. The transformation of Peters’s thought towards the concept of power is extensive and perspective becomes the only ‘formula for happiness’. The concept of culture has two different meanings in both English and German. First, culture is any account of human affairs and their developments in human development. Second, culture is the concept of the existence of a people, its values, values of methods or institutions, the identity of heroes and villains, etc. In other words, is not just a variety of histories, but a living, real, and genuine expression of the cultural method by which a concept of worldliness or suffering is symbolised, is transformed by the attention of events 1780s and ‘modern’ audiences.

At the same time, culture is a set of practices or institutions that a particular people can subscribe to, has a specific meaning for its state, or is founded upon and a product of – or is surrounded by – healthy? For example, the diet of a modern German,  the cultivation of which was to be called ‘spiritual’. Likewise, the use of the concept of a model organism is by no means an isolated outgrowth – for example, the diet of a modern German is a model of human development that is based on a productive and healthful over-abundance. Also, the healthy variations a diet, daily routines, or social institutions have on that organism.

In the history of thought, the Enlightenment refers to eighteenth-century European thought, with an emphasis upon the use of a scientifically understood reason to solve political, philosophical, religious, or moral problems, and a judicious scepticism in matters metaphysical.  The banner of Enlightenment ideas was token up, especially to contrast the romanticism and nationalism. To be sure,  Enlightenment is not as a single historical period, but as a broader tendency towards the overcoming of metaphysical and moral constraints. Moreover,  the Enlightenment is naïve about religious metaphysics, and that it had no inner relation to the French Revolution. This manifests itself in the political sphere that Enlightenment political ideals relate to democracy and equality.

Along with Heraclitus, Epicurus is the ancient Greek philosopher. Epicurus took the atomism of Democritus and extended it into an ethical philosophy that had significant influence. The vital idea from Epicurus includes: first, liberation from irrational fears (e.g. of the gods) leading to a sense of tranquillity is the aim of the good life. In its extreme, this is a kind of self-hypnosis or deep sleep; similarly, liberation from desires extends beyond one’s capacity; third, liberation includes the ethical values of friendship and solitude; the last,  the gods are at least uninterested in human affairs, and indeed there is a hint in Epicurus that the gods are projections of human ethical values. In either case, it follows that the cosmos should be contemplated, but without danger, as chaotic and without purposes.

Epigone means that someone who believes that all great striving or achievement is behind him or her. This is a feeling about our contemporaries, victims of the historical sense.

This concept of equal or equality is employed to analyses about strong or weak powers and the political implications of powers in equilibrium. The essential use of equality is in discussing the moral/political notions associated with democracy or class.

Eternal recurrence (or ‘return’) is among the most famous and widely discussed concepts. There are two broad (and not mutually exclusive) ways of interpreting eternal recurrence. Either it is a metaphysical/cosmological claim concerning reality; or it is a test of – or element within – the highest affirmation of life.

The Christian believes that order worships a herd of cows, and that the original meaning of the animal was acknowledged; that is, approved or disapproved of with the spirit of 'running out' or 'running out' – this is no longer the 'nature' of the beast so that 'becoming' is allowing 'becoming' to affirmata. The thought of becoming a god is a transformation, indeed a defining characteristic of the Dionysian state from primitive to modern. Here, the human agent is no longer prone to conditional obedience but has the strength to will into the future to do so. Being is not just the appearance of something; it can even be understood as perspective. Being is not just the perception of future needs – an existence akin to discovering new things. Instead, the way to appreciate the Dionysian is to look at an increasing part of the self.

A criminal is a lawbreaker, someone who acts against accepted traditions. There are three essential ideas. First, the observation that changes or developments in-laws are made, often enough, because of lawbreakers. The ‘free-doer’ and the criminal will at one stage be subjected to the same defamation. Second, it is the concept of punishment that the notion of retribution from the fact that someone outside the social contract is effectively at war with that society; sanction is thus the criminal expelled. Also, this notion is pursued that our behaviour towards the criminal should not be founded on revenge, but rehabilitation or healing from an illness. Punishment is a means of keeping power by having the right to find guilty and impose the law. Third, it is about the psychology of responsibility, the state of having the strength to act but not having the power later to affirm the act. Thus, the portrait of the pale criminal. This idea is related to N’s perseverance or courage in passages. There is also a line of thought – an endpoint of the softening of morality – that denies all responsibility, and for that reason treats the criminal very differently.

The concept of critique has both a broader and a narrower meaning. The general sense of critique is to approach an object, especially some cultural object, such as a historical text, objectively and without pre-conceptions, to understand it or evaluate it. Thus, today, we might talk about a literary critic or film critic, and a philosophy student might be asked to ‘critically appraise’ an idea. An essential historical influence here is ‘critical hermeneutics’, an eighteenth and nineteenth-century mode of study that viewed biblical texts as historical objects rather than as revelation or, at least, not as pure revelation. The discipline of philology here is, to a considerable degree influenced by early hermeneutics.

The narrower concept of critique stems primarily from Kant, where it has a specific philosophical meaning. For Kant, ‘critique’ means to investigate the basis of any human ability (e.g. understanding, judgement, reason) to discover both its fundamental, a priori principles and its limits. The laws are what gives that ability its legitimacy, which is to say a guarantee of its value concerning specific goals (e.g. the principles of the understanding make possible knowledge of the natural world); the limits define possible usages of the ability which are illegitimate (e.g. knowledge of a supernatural world).

The concept of critique also inherits some perspective from Kant. For example, it seems to be at stake in his analysis of Socrates – Socrates was incapable of turning the logical drive against itself. N introduces his new, modified sense of critique in discussing University philosophy and its association with the state. Here, he proposes an experimental type of critique. One cannot critique words with words – because of the account of the origin of words as described, for example in ‘On Truth and Lies’ – instead of life supplies the principle, and the possibility of living in accordance with a philosophy is its legitimacy. The philosopher of the future is ‘critic in body and soul’, although this is still, like the sceptic, only part of the comprehensive sense of the philosopher. Also, and again, truth needs an experimental form of critique; this is not the ‘self-critique’ of knowledge (the critique of words with words) but remains within the orbit of the ascetic ideal.

Traditionally, pity or ‘love of the neighbour’ distinguish the human being from the animal or ‘cruel and playful’ nature. More importantly, such moral practices are often themselves cruel or even founded upon cruelty, to the point that cruelty to oneself (asceticism) is accounted a virtue. This point is made concerning the reactive values of Christian thought. This artificial contrast between human and nature leads the emphasis on the role of cruelty in human affairs

The values of the period are well advanced (e.g. gravity, magnetism, etc.). The generation of wisdom going forward is both a task in and is conceived as the 'creation of the new' (ostensibly because this is how life was supposed to have come to be) and, concomitantly, a future of new possibilities is also called a ‘future of destruction’. For any elaboration of the concept of ‘distant thought’, however, this future necessity is only understood as a moment (the ‘fishing tackle’) and not as a whole as an entity becomes universal. In this case, the ‘monster of evil’ is the right to create the ‘evil’ once and for all.

The concept of culture can be used broadly, to understand how things are made or made things are made. To do so would be a return to the original Greek concept of askesis (training), where the initiative and the question are replaced by a flashing of a ‘egoistic’ idea of death. Likewise, future philosophers will understand that ‘they got it wrong’, and similarly, the good and the bad, whatever the origin, should be recognised as fundamentally wrong. Also, culture comprises the notion of a culture of philosophers, who are search and rescue and ultimately crushed by the temptation of pity. The culture is the way to a way of life or the way of the human type as the overall natural product of human will and reaction. This is a kind of miracle. Similarly, culture includes the idea of comedy or acting as a kind of discipline, to make the world see (literally or metaphorically) what is going on. This is a long, ugly way of thinking.

Convalescence means the course of suffering and surviving from illnesses caused by physiologies or cultures. The sickness led from cultures, in a sense, is by no means entirely metaphorical - that is ideas, beliefs, values, or modes of life that one has inherited and with which he or she is surrounded. When we talk about ‘convalescence’, it usually links to this second kind of illness, and its overcoming, in mind. Convalescence as an overcoming is thus contrasted to comforting as a relieving of suffering. Convalescence is also part of the cycle of creative states, linked to exhaustion and the need for repose.

A conviction is a belief, held stubbornly to be 'unqualified truth'. There is a notion developed by the dangers and origin of conviction that one must be a 'noble traitor' to one's convictions. Convictions are opposed by both the genius of science and justice. Therefore, those who embrace science and justice are considered as the wanderer,  a thinker who has no home or 'destination' (both understood as convictions).

Courage and bravery are an ancient virtue that we need to appreciate and revalue. Courage is the ability to stick firmly to life and the real, and not to borrow one’s beliefs and values from imaginary other worlds or modes of being. Likewise, it is courage not to manufacture one’s beliefs and values by a fearful negation of becoming, uncertainty and suffering, which are the conditions of life and the real. Such courage in the type is represented by Epictetus (the Stoic philosopher who had been a slave) and contrasts it with the Christian slave characterized by faith and hope in a different life. A few sections later, courage is proclaimed as a key ‘future virtue’: the arrogance to understand and not be afraid of the world. This courage is not dissimilar to generosity. Thus, the courageous type of thinker who is aware of the ‘cruelty of the intellectual conscience’, which does not simplify but insists upon multiplicity and perspective. Such courage is a form of self-overcoming. Zarathustra talks about those among his disciples who are too cowardly to change the direction of their willing and thus soon abandon him in favour of their contentment. Likewise, it is Zarathustra’s courage that tells the Spirit of Gravity to get off his back.

Happy because unconcerned with past or future, or not stricken by heavy thoughts (here, chewing the cud means focused in the present moment, not prone to nausea). The cow is also patient and seeing, and thus a metaphor for reading and interpretation as an art lost in modernity; rumination means to consider and contemplate without hurry. The cow is trusting, not slighted by distance or change; warm and reassuring like a faithful companion. The cow is an essential religious symbol in many Eastern religions: the ‘voluntary beggar’, learning contentment from a herd of cows, is a portrait of Jesus as
