 actions concerning actual being. Accordingly, to set up a new future for human life is to create a future, every now and then. Moreover, those who are contemplating marriage should ask themselves ‘have you the right to wish for a child’.

The notion of the ‘eternal child’  is an allusion to Ovid’s account of Jacchus (associated with Dionysus, particularly in the idea of perpetual rebirth).  The concept also has a reference to Heraclitus, who wrote that time, or the creator, is a child building with, then scattering, his playthings. Mozart was often called an ‘eternal child’. The concept of child has two-fold. First, that psychologically, there is no sharp divide between childhood and adulthood, and to believe there is shown an unhealthy devotion to seriousness. Second, that in the ‘genuine man, a child is hidden, it wants to play’  – that is, the higher human will embrace the concepts of play, toys, laughter, or fantasy. Thus, if knowledge removes its playthings, it will have to create others in a perpetual cycle.

China and the Chinese have two aspects. First, the impression in Asian thought which was inspired at least in part by Schopenhauer. Second, the Chinese have an entirely different form of life, to the extent that the Chinese are a distinct type of human being. This is manifested in their valuation of work, and attributes of the great age of their civilization.

There are three aspects of Christianity. First, and famously, it is the bitter attack on Christianity, especially its effects on modernity. Christianity is responsible for breeding (or domesticating) human beings into a herd animal; Christianity espouses hatred of rationality, but also the body and any bodily passion (i.e. one not directed towards God); more generally, it is in part responsible for the prevalence of the ascetic ideal and the practices it devises, which in turn has ruined the health and taste of modern Europe and continues in disguised form in morality and science; it is responsible for a whole host of moral concepts but especially that of pity; in its denigration of becoming concerning actual being, it is in part responsible for the cultural paralysis induced by the historical sense; Christianity involves the destruction of the ability to read philologically; finally, it has waged war upon the noble, healthy and powerful (the ‘slave revolt’), and in the end broken most of the great (e.g. Wagner) before the cross. Much of this damage is historical; however, importantly, many of these values or practices continue surreptitiously, even without their basis intact. This attack is directed primarily towards Christianity because of its dominant position within European history and present. Still, some of these points are also valid concerning other religions (especially Judaism) or philosophies (especially Platonism).

Second, Christianity is a frequent object of genealogical analysis – that is, a historical account of the origin and development of concepts, values, or practices. This way of thinking overlaps with the first, above.  Jesus is characterised as a kind of Buddhist, whose teachings were catastrophically misinterpreted by Paul. Paul’s notion of the impossibility of virtue and the need for revenge against the law. Here have various accounts of the origin of the concept of sin; similarly, the idea of debt or guilt when raised to its highest point, necessitated Christianity’s stroke of genius: The God sacrificed.

Third, it is about the positive contribution that Christianity – despite its explicit aims – has had. Christianity involves a powerful cultural drive to produce greatness in the form of the saint (although its association with the modern state corrupted this). Similarly, Christianity provided human beauty and refinement. In France, the Christian realized itself as the supreme human being – and thus also this is the place where high free spirits could arise since they needed ‘perfect opponents. Christianity has taught us moral scepticism. Christianity rescued the ancient world from its decadency, and in some way preserved it. Christian practices, including especially the ascetic, have produced an agile intellect capable of understanding perspective. Likewise, Christian values and institutions can now be understood as tools for the advantage of the higher nobility.

The notion of the impotence of 'City' can be found in 'antiquarian' history, which is associated with cities. Such account at best serves life only as preservation and not creation but, at worst, 'mummifies' life. The city is also associated with the 'mob'. It is thus a place where wisdom is all but impossible. Therefore, calling for a revision of the standard architecture of large cities to ensure 'places for reflection' is quite vital. The city becomes a metaphor for a desire to depict,

 actions of will. Buddhism is to be praised for its lack of theism and pursuit of the otherworldly, and its freedom from ressentiment. On both these grounds, the historical Jesus is described as a Buddhistic. Nevertheless, it must be judged as a passive nihilistic form of life.

Buildings are represented a whole host of symbols here, involving the construction of, living in, decay or demolition of built structures. Most of these symbols are conventional and not difficult to understand.  Architecture occasionally is in a literal manner. Highlights include the concept about our diminished sense of the symbolic nature of building and architecture as will to power), and the observations about city architecture.

Butterfly is a vital image with far-reaching but not always clear implications. Broadly, the image of butterfly is in a negative, though also in a positive way. The critical meaning of the former is thoughtless living in and for the present. Butterfly is thus modern humanity with its newspapers and petty politics. There are two aspects to the positive meaning. First, the butterfly is childlike, innocent, and therefore able to relate to its world without the heaviness of values. Second, the butterfly is a standard mode of existence, lightly and laughingly affirming of its conditions and its fate. The butterfly, in this sense, is also eager for growth. The butterfly is used in this sense, but now with an emphasis on the problematic sacrifices that are the precondition of such growth. The idea of cocoon is about the Apollonian cultural drive being forced to disguise itself as mania for persuasion, but re-emerging in modernity.

Caesar is a Roman general, politician and then ‘dictator’ of Rome. To mention Caesar and Napoleon together metaphorize instances of something exceptionally free, characterised by scepticism and the throwing off faiths, a moment of beauty and genius. Caesar, the tyrant, is thus also an example of the opportunities and dangers of decadence, for the highest type is always ‘five paces from tyranny’. It is precisely that danger which is their condition of growth.

'Camel' is the first of the three 'transformations of the spirit'. Importantly, the spirit as camel is already a transformation, and not a default position of the human. The camel wishes the bear as heavy a burden as possible, to feel its strength and test that strength. The weights are those of the deliberate assumption of humility and self-mockery, confining oneself to a specialization, discovering dangerous or unpleasant truths, rejecting the pity of others, and overcoming one's overcoming (i.e. departing a cause when it is victorious). In other words, the camel is the free spirit as far as he or she recognizes these states as burdens; exhibits veneration towards the burdens, that interprets them as valuable; and, knows him or herself to be strong enough to bear them.

The images of cat relate to the cat family from domestic cats to tigers and lions. The lion stands for exceptional strength, ravenous desire, strong will to power, but is primarily destructive and only prefiguring creation. The figure of the lion is an echo of Plato’s analogy, where the lion stands for the thump’s element of the soul and spiritedness. The lion figures prominently hint the sign that the days of loneliness are over. Also, the symbol of lions is as combining power with gentleness.

The tiger is one of the animals associated in mythology with Dionysus, which explicitly refers to fat. The tiger’s wildness is not tamed by, but directly not opposed to Dionysus’ needs or purposes. As one lush growth of the tropical south, the tiger is a symbol of wanton and sudden destructiveness (always about to leap) and over-abundance (‘Homer’s Contest’). Thus, also the tiger is

Then, the next two sections supply a book-by-book commentary on his work, and then a summary of what he considers its most tremendous significance, namely ‘the uncovering of Christian morality’.

The literal meaning of the term 'economy' in Greek is 'household'. Economy is one of the most frequent concepts used to describe the interrelated, systematic nature of life (or, for example, the soul). It is suitable as far as both are dynamic and relational. That is, for example, an economy must involve both those who buy and sell; analogously, the system of life will have to apply both active and passive, weak and intense moments of will to power.

The term education has a broader meaning in culture and thus is also employed to express the process of cultivation. However, it is often used as equivalent to Rehang. Education, and significantly higher education, was a perennial theme. 

Following reforms in the early nineteenth century, which were primarily led by Humboldt, Prussia had one of the first ‘modern’ education systems in the world: publicly funded schools, teacher certification and further or higher education available based upon ability rather than class. Likewise, Humboldt had a significant role in the creation of the modern university, enshrining principles like academic independence, general rather than vocational education, and the close relation between teaching and research. However, such reforms were counter-productive, being founded on a Socratic notion of science in which knowledge is understood as information rather than a way of living, a way of thinking or involving genuine insight. The non-vocational system was serving a different kind of vocation: creating servants of economy and state, and merely reproducing or reinforcing the current system of values. Moreover, without a cultivated grasp of German, classical education is only ‘a leap in the dark’, and there is no possibility of a genuine or authentic culture. Education for culture is something different from knowledge for economic social or political roles.

Modern education, with its post-reform shape and the universal franchise, is an offshoot of modern ideas of equality and democracy. Education should be a privilege and not versatile, although this privilege should not be bound to the class. Universities have become increasingly compartmentalized, with narrow specialization, a lack of vision and redundant experimentation. Likewise, the historical sense pervades all education, including the teaching of language, taught as a dead object of study rather than a living practice, as ‘living through’ what one learns. In contrast, the philosopher must be self-educated after having passed through a variety of specializations, in order then to use them as instruments.

Many moral systems have a fundamental distinction between egoistic (or selfish) motives or acts and those that are altruistic. Altruism refers to an action based entirely on concern for the welfare of others. Thus, in particular moralities, it characterizes the highest of moral virtues, or indeed the basis of morality itself. Altruism is often claimed psychologically impossible. Altruism,  at best, is an ideal caused by suffering from a lack of love or care, a sacrifice of one aspect of the self for the egoism of another, to avoid a feeling of impotence, or gain a sense of power, a desire for possession, or an illusion propagated by those who see their self- interest in becoming a function of another, or of the whole. At worst, it is a destructive and decadent ideal. Indeed, altruism involves a contradiction: the moral demand for altruism for the sake of utility is, itself, not altruistic. The feeling for others, or their state, by great humans, is often misinterpreted as altruism, when in fact it is an expression of power. Altruism is the key theme in the discussions of Spencer.

The opposition between egoism and altruism is either a false distinction (i.e. there are only varieties of egoistic acts) or one which carries a negative value for life (i.e. an ideal of altruistic acts contributes to human weakness or degeneration). The removal of the distinction leads to a ‘revaluation’ of egoism. The value of selfishness is measured by the value of the self, depending upon whether individuals are the ascending or the descending line of life. There are, in other words, many types of selfishness or egoism which are ‘despicable’ (the ‘phantom’ ego); it is selfish to consider one’s own judgement a universal law, the ‘tidal waves of selfishness’ found in absolute ages, and likewise greed or lust (in un
