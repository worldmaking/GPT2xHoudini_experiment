  ’have power over’ existence insofar as that existence is beautiful,  and not nihilistic, eternal, or degenerate. An attack on the concept of guilt if there is any remaining redeeming virtue is an example. The adoption of a ‘new ideal’ is an important one this: not only are those values valued but also creates that are ‘chaos’. That is, the new ideal must involve the opposition of the creativeness of values to the tranquillity of a world and soul – an idea recently posited in the sphere of direction’s inner inner track time and direction, or the ‘spirit of gravity’, who has direction but is also ‘a burden’. Thus, the degeneration of the will means that we moderns do not understand the depth of ‘lust’; this is partly because we are too dependent upon external models of living (such as knowledge), and also partly because modernity is ‘literally looks’ into the abyss and sees that it is a metaphor for sin. The decline of the will means that we are helpless against our greatest desires.

The term of decadence with similar meanings include 'degeneration' and 'corruption'. 'Decadent' was a term of abuse used by French neo-classical or conservative critics against the romanticism of painters like Delacroix or novelists such as Hugo. Later, writers like Baudelaire adopted the term as their own, using it to express scepticism towards many dominant moral or political values. The usage of the word 'decadence' late in the late nineteenth centuries has represented the concepts of corruption, decline or degeneration date. Baudelaire is termed 'a typical decadency', and all references to him associate him with Wagner (Baudelaire was one of Wagner's champions in France). So, the meaning of 'decadence' is any period of cultural history – or any state of the human organism – which has lost its good taste and value judgement  (thus it is associated with pity; with Kantian duty; with Schopenhauer's quieting of the will), health and sureness of instinct, discipline and sense of a future. It is to be associated either with the decline of old cultures or with moral revolutions.

The Kantian and Platonic-Christian metaphysical distinction between appearance and ‘true world’ is termed a ‘sign of decadence’. For all these reasons at Christianity is called a ‘monster of decadence’. Decadent cultures are exhausted cultures, and such cultures often exhibit a pathological over-sensitivity; indeed, often an inability not to respond, lacking the strength to inhibit one’s passions. Alternatively, the decadent culture can manifest itself as a craving for stimulation (for the voluptuous, the exotic, the dangerous). Importantly, this desire for stimulation is a symptom and not a cause – as those who react ascetically against such stimulation believe. Thus, decadence in the form of a culture of exhaustion that needs stimulation often precipitates a reaction, which is the ‘gathering gloom of the religious-moral pathos’.

Most of the above could serve as an account of the notion of degeneration or corruption also. If there is a distinction to be drawn from decadence, degeneration tends to have a stronger physiological emphasis, and is used more often in specific cases (e.g. the instincts of the criminal,  or the degeneration of individual philosophers), and is sometimes associated particularly with an increasing homogeneity of society (e.g.  the ‘blondish’), then it might be called ‘a characteristic of the degenerated state that it is stubborn and self-contradictory’. Corruption, on the other hand, is one which is frayed and missing the taste of a past, and which can be found nourished on a optimism that includes a ‘foolish’ and ‘bold’ness about it.

An ageing and over-comfortable society produce either a ‘variation’ into something higher, or degeneration and monstrosity. Corruption is a term applied to the ‘autumn’ of all cultures, and the time of the rise of individuals ‘the seed-bearers of the future’. In other words, decadence is a watershed moment of great danger and promise. Human forms of life can cause both exhaust themselves and degenerate into a herd or mob, or the corruption can blossom into new ways of life and values can be created.

At a stage of human development before the formation of any social order, the primary function of the intellect is deception (‘On Truth and Lies’). Only within a social order is truth-telling or honesty valued

Anti-Semitism is a symptom of a weak and defensive culture, of which the present day teenager is part; this is true even of a leading Jewish figure such as Judaic.  The banner of modern anti-Semitism is the notion of the successor of God to (semi-) human society. that which is divinely sanctioned life. This notion of the death of the ideal of theology which is in part a false sense, as the ascetic ideal tries to correct an aspect of him or herself that was defective. A few sections later, the notion of anti-Semitism is entirely replaced by the use of the term, rooted in spiritual conviction, which is only realized when conventional methods are in danger of falling prey to a notion of pity.

There are three stages of philosophical thinking: the theoretical stage, when there is a need, showing (scholarly), the practical (religious), and the tragic (apostate). The philosopher lies dormant in the abyss; the tragedy is ‘the final blow’. The political economy of culture and political science is a ‘critique’; the economy of culture is a ‘critique’ of manners,’ in the pursuit of knowledge of the highest and highest forms of life. The state is the ‘greatest danger to all human existence’. Political economy is a ‘lauded return’ to the original concept of by-Homer’s, where there were two perspectives: the former is the awareness of dangers in the form of a life, while the second is ‘more dangerous’. The former is the life sense, which is concerned with the life of the maxims of culture, and with our generalized idea of the necessary, or the preservation of the latter. The former is the ‘kindness’ warrior who has to overcome one aspect of his or her strength, and then have triumphantly ride ‘back’ the ‘greatest danger. The instinct for danger is not always productive, however, and must be had or discharged in a way that does not threaten. This was the role of a certain honesty or gentleness during the early years of civilization. 

The AAA was founded on the notion that a culture drives it instinctsually, is incapable of stability and growth, and thus must be ruined. The second reason for the separation of culture and culture-in-themselves is not found, but the influence of Apollonian and Socratic education much more generally than Wagner is an example, and is used in more ways than one. The formation of childlike adulthood is primarily discussed, in such detail as ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ and ‘The Birth of Tragedy’.

The notion of the impotence of 'City' can be found in 'antiquarian' history, which is associated with cities. Such account at best serves life only as preservation and not creation but, at worst, 'mummifies' life. The city is also associated with the 'mob'. It is thus a place where wisdom is all but impossible. Therefore, calling for a revision of the standard architecture of large cities to ensure 'places for reflection' is quite vital. The city becomes a metaphor for a desire to depict, even in art, the ugly side of life.

The terms ‘classes’ or ‘castes’ mean recognised and persistent differences between group and group, and not discrete instances among groups. There are two broad ways of analysing class: either it arises because of external circumstance, or because of intrinsic nature. Liberals and socialists tend to take the former view: in themselves, all human beings are of equal value and equal ability, but historical accidents left one group with certain privileges and characteristics. In socialism, this situation is considered unjust and is to be set right through revolution. The key figures here are Marx and Engels. For liberalism, the given case may be regarded as acceptable provided reforms yield ‘equality of opportunity’. Essential historical data here are Hobbes, Rousseau, and Mill. As far as the Reformation involved criticism of the grip of the priestly class over the religious life of all humans, who are in themselves equal before God, then Luther too should be mentioned. The intrinsic view, on the other hand, claims that there are real differences between individuals and groups, and these mean that the existing class order is broadly natural and beneficial. These differences may be supposed to have arisen historically, biologically or be divinely sanctioned, among other explanations. Key figures would include Burke and Carlyle, as well as Catholic defenders of the church hierarchy.

The two elements of which modernity is most proud are incompatible. Science and culture require a ‘scholarly’ or ‘aristocratic�

The Old Testament is one of the greatest, certainly the most sublime, pieces of literature, and the record of a great people. The New Testament a distasteful account of a catastrophic turn in European history. Luther's translation of the Bible into German is one of the critical events of the reformation and had a substantial formative effect upon the history of German. 'Beyond Good and Evil' is full of references to biblical events and persons, either for direct discussion or metaphorically (i.e. the images of love, gift and sacrifice are allusions to the life of Christ).

The bird is a symbol of rapid ascent, of something that needs and desires to be ahead of its time, to show spiritual growth. Birds must also be light, able to throw off burdens. The bird is thus in opposition to the spirit of heaviness. The flock of doves is precisely chosen because it is a conventional symbol of gentleness and peace but combined with the bird’s lightness and need for the ascent, and this is unlike a herd of sheep or cows, say. The dove image also has significant biblical echoes. 

The eagle (Adler) is the most common bird mentioned in N. The most famous use of the eagle is the symbol of a healthy and honest pride. The eagle can view things as beneath it; this is both a specific comprehensive sight which is not an abstraction and honest pride. The snake is cleverness. The combination of these animals (the eagle carrying the snake) is something rare: those who have pride do not understand themselves; those who are clever tend to be self-loathing. It seems likely that they also represent two significant mythic and cultural inputs into Europe, the eagle as the masculine Greek, the serpent as the feminine Judaic; their union is an expression of an as yet unrealised ‘wholeness’ of the human. The eagle is a bird of prey. Birds and especially the eagle, thus also stand for a kind of strength. Its happiness lies in relishing the terror of the great heights and the abyss, rather than in ignorance of that terror. Moreover, the eagle’s hunt is direct, straight down; it is thus, considered on its own, a noble ‘stupidity’. It is nourished on innocence, it both loves and hates the lamb – thus mirroring the relationship to the human, which is loved because of its yet unspoiled possibilities.

‘The Birth of Tragedy’, with its lack of scholarly apparatus, energetic and figure-laden prose, philosophical and psychological speculation, and a mixture of ancient and modern contexts, was not what the philological community expected. It has three primary purposes and correspondingly divides into three sections. First, to elaborate a theory of ancient Greek tragedy as a synthesis of two metaphysically understood cultural drives (Apollonian and Dionysian). In this way, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ solves the relationship between cheerfulness and pessimism ingeniously - how could the Greeks, with their in-depth knowledge of suffering and futility, have remained cheerful? Second, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ traces the reasons for the decline of tragedy to a third drive, the Socratic, which is also the advent of science and modernity. Third, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ seeks to understand what it would mean, and what it would take, for tragedy to be reborn in the present. The account of culture is thus revealed to be a general one, and not specific to Greece. The book is heavily influenced (although not entirely uncritically) by Schopenhauer, and especially in its third part plays homage to Wagner.

Otto von Bismarck was the leading political figure in Germany from the 1860s to 1890. Bismarck provoked wars that in turn led to the unification of Germany around Prussian leadership. His brand of pragmatic and power politics, and his nationalism, made him as a symbol of all that was wrong with history.

Blood is a metaphor of life and a key symbol in Christianity for a life made eternal by being cleansed of sin. Notably, blood stands for the specific mode of life of an individual or group; thus, history transformed into blood: morals part of our ‘flesh and blood’. Blood is accumulated meaning-it is accumulated, like all accumulation. Highlights of carrying out an accumulation include becoming famous and appearing in history classes. While on the revolution's way of becoming  well-meaning and influential, the revolution's enemies will think your courage is a virtue, and will demand you wear a ‘jay-c will do’. When in
