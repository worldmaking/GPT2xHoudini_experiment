In Northern European mythology and folklore, dwarves make a typical appearance as small supernatural creatures. They are a general term of abuse, meaning only in literature. The story of the dwarf Alberici's cursesising at the hands of Alberici's ‘madhouses of culture’; the theme of culture again. Dwarves play a vital role in Wagner's Ring cycle.

There are two ways to use the image of a dwarf. First, more generally, as meaning a type of human who is ill, degenerate, or weak – or who is in some other form of little cultural significance. Second, more specifically, the 'spirit of gravity' is a 'dwarf'. This is both because the spirit of gravity is Zarathustra's internalization of the 'serious' values of the people (i.e. the dwarves in the first sense), and also in allusion to Wagner's narrative of the dwarf Alberici's cursesising a priestly class problem, and the reported disappearance of the great human priest.

The emphasis of 'earth' has the same meaning as the stress of 'this world'. Thus, earth means the whole of the real, including human beings, stripped of any metaphysical additions and values. Earth is opposed to that which is supposed to be transcendent to earth, superior to or 'above' earth. In comparison to these, the earth is traditionally slandered as something lowly, dirty, illusory, dark, and fallen. 'Earth', with its more direct connections to mythology, connotes these values much more readily than 'world'. Because of its alignment to reality and life, the over human is the 'sense of the earth' and 'speaks from the heart of the earth'. Since the earth is associated with matter, the 'atom' is also called an 'earth-residue'. That is, the atom is the last hold-out of a metaphysical belief in material substance.

Sometimes, also, 'the earth' is used as the proper country or nation of human beings, ignoring historically specific nations and peoples. Thus, the over human as the 'sense of the earth' means dominion over the whole earth. Because of its global reach, Christianity has been able to make the earth a 'madhouse' while free spirits are taking on the task of the management of the earth as a whole.

Ecce Homo is one of Nietzsche’s last works, written in 1888, but not published until 20 years later. It is an intellectual autobiography of infamous immodesty. The book falls into two parts. The first concerns are his way of living with a discussion of factors like diet and climate, and why these are important. Then, the next two sections supply a book-by-book commentary on his work, and then a summary of what he considers its most tremendous significance, namely ‘the uncovering of Christian morality’.

The literal meaning of the term 'economy' in Greek is 'household'. Economy is one of the most frequent concepts used to describe the interrelated, systematic nature of life (or, for example, the soul). It is suitable as far as both are dynamic and relational. That is, for example, an economy must involve both those who buy and sell; analogously, the system of life will have to apply both active and passive, weak and intense moments of will to power.

The term education has a broader meaning in culture and thus is also employed to express the process of cultivation. However, it is often used as equivalent to Rehang. Education, and significantly higher education, was a perennial theme. 

Following reforms in the early nineteenth century, which were primarily led by Humboldt, Prussia had one of the first ‘modern’ education systems in the world: publicly funded schools, teacher certification and further or higher education available based upon ability rather than class. Likewise, Humboldt had a significant role in the creation of the modern university, enshrining principles like academic independence, general rather than vocational education, and the close relation between teaching and research. However, such reforms were counter-productive, being founded on a Socratic notion of science in which knowledge is understood as information rather than a way of living, a way of thinking or involving genuine insight. The non-vocational system was serving a different kind of vocation: creating servants of economy and state, and merely reproducing or reinforcing the current system of values. Moreover, without a cultivated grasp of German, classical education is only ‘a leap in the dark’, and there is no possibility of a genuine or authentic culture. Education for culture is something different from knowledge for economic

Burinary-house life. Leisure is, in a sense, the fate of the human. It is thus one factor contributing to nihilism, and a form of life that can experience joy in becoming is an essential new ideal. Sixth, there are several incomplete attempts from the mid-1880s on to produce a metaphysical argument that relates the concept of becoming to eternal recurrence. At least, eternal recurrence is a way of thinking about value in a world characterised by becoming, and thus by the critique of values mentioned above. A life that could be willed eternally would be the only possible remaining criterion of value – it would approximate being – and yet such an experience would also have to be understood as healthy and ascending. This is the ‘opposite ideal’ to the pessimistic or indeed nihilistic state.

The phrase ‘to become who or what one is’ is an adaptation of a line from Pindar’s Second Pythian Ode. The individual is a ‘piece of fate’ meaning it cannot be fundamentally recast in the image of some external (i.e. moral) value. To do so would be a double betrayal of oneself, a deviation or distortion of the life one is, resulting in all kinds of physical or spiritual degeneration. Nor is it a question of choosing to shape oneself in any way – for the individual does not have that freedom of will. In some sense, then, the individual already is what it is, or at least is already pregnant with itself. Becoming oneself is a needing to get out of one’s way, not to try to find out about oneself, and not to struggle, while the ‘governing idea’ within one grows. This idea of not knowing oneself is in contradiction to the Socratic maxim. This not struggling, though, means to align oneself with the fate of oneself – and this, in turn, requires an absolute honesty (although not necessarily a conscious one). This honesty will involve, if not self-knowledge, then at least the strength for truth more generally; also a specific act of creation, a questioning or critical attitude towards one’s age, and a refusal of external models of living (external to one’s alignment to fate), in favour of an internal adaptation. For this reason, also, Zarathustra requests that his disciples do not think of him as offering a way of life (‘guard yourself against Zarathustra’ ).

Bee is a  Symbol of industry (thus akin to ant), building or swarming. Bees creating honey is a symbol of patiently extracting, accumulating, and concentrating, indeed committed to such accumulation and unaware of anything else. Gathering of honey is related to autumnal ripening or pregnancy.

Beer is particularly associated with Germany; thus, it becomes a symbol of a German way of narcotising.

The concept of being in a way akin to Parmenides or Plato: true being is that which is, eternally, and does not become. Moreover, even concerning everyday entities, that things we know are not genuinely permanent or self- identical, we still employ the concepts of being, as if they were true being. Belief in the existence of nature is a crucial feature of metaphysics and carries a moral value.

Belief has two different meanings in both English and German. First, belief in the sense of opinion, the unjustified or careless views that someone or a group happens to have. Second, belief in the spirit of faith, often now in a religious sense. A religious sceptic would claim there is very little difference between them. Still, in many philosophical traditions, there is a significant difference: one can acquire evidence such that opinion becomes knowledge, but the object of faith could not in principle be an object of knowledge. The notions of a disciple, or the ‘love of man for the sake of God’ should be understood as ways of rethinking the notion of religious faith in the absence of a transcendent or impossible object.

Belief often relates to metaphysical or religious concepts as being objects of ‘faith,’ that these individual items of belief are part of a system which serves one dominant faith, around which one builds a form of life. In this case, it is the faith of the weak that they someday will be the masters; because these concepts are abstract, not the concrete expression of the life of a people, this kind of faith is universalising and arises from ressentiment. It refuses on principle to tolerate any other faith (or form of life). 

However, opinions and beliefs are legitimated by the kind of person who holds them. There has differentiation between the opinions of ‘most people’ and those of

Burging image', 'telling', or 'telling lies' – and the existence of internal change, and which is characterized by constant, healthy change. This is both a liberation but also a crushing blow (for it means that the burden of creating and justifying values falls upon the human). It also means that the burden of creating and justifying values is on the human being.

At a stage of human development before the formation of any social order, the primary function of the intellect is deception (‘On Truth and Lies’). Only within a social order is truth-telling or honesty valued. Moreover, the foundation of knowledge lies in a set of simplifications or ‘basic errors’, embedded in our lives as its condition. Therefore, the greatest of philosophers have always had to deceive themselves about both the nature of things and the nature of life. Analogously, at the origin of virtue lies a long period of dissimulation of virtue – this eventually sublimates itself and produces virtue.  Similar points are made about social relations and friendship. In all these various ways, then, deception is the real foundation of what is typically called virtue. The idea is generalized as the production of states from their opposites. Nevertheless, honesty understood differently is an important concept.

The notion of democracy is inclusive, as any mode of thought that ascribes homogeneity or uniformity to the real. In political thought, therefore, democracy involves the passing of power to the masses and conceptions such as equality of rights or moral value. The political conceptions of democracy parallel the accounts of class in a democracy. Thus, the concept of democracy, at least act as a provisional instrument for stability and the overcoming of militarized nationalism. Following its in-deep idea, a ‘future democracy’ is characterized by independence of opinion, and modes of life and employment. This future form is distinguished from current forms, such as parliamentarians. The democratic ideal is also considered as that which breaks up rigid class hierarchies. It thus liberates individual ambition, although at the cost of a collective and enduring sense of the future, of the executive power of the group, and productive differences. Democracy produces a people incapable of command and is in danger of falling prey to a tyrant.

Importantly, though, that first broad definition of democracy means that it influences non-political domains. The democracy of concepts whereby modernity considers anyone as ill who is single-minded; the democratic notion of universal natural law; or the democratic prejudice that now pervades science and eliminates one of the basic concepts of life, genuine activity.

Depth has several meanings. First, depth describes the more interesting or revealing rule (i.e. those who are not among the great and noble), as opposed to the exception. Second, that which is ‘below’ the superficial, especially conventional interpretations of psychological phenomena. Third, similarly, some people or peoples are ‘profound’ as opposed to those who are only superficial. Partly because interesting and revealing, depth is often the necessary precondition or accompaniment of height and ascent.

Descartes is a seventeenth-century French philosopher. His importance is being first in the line of ‘modern’ philosophers who offer a critique of the Christian concept of soul. Similarly, Descartes’ idea that animals are biological machines is praised, as well as Descartes as a psychologist. Nevertheless, Descartes’ faith in the immediate integrity of self-reflection is a frequent target.

Desert is a common symbol that it stands for some mode of life or method of enquiry that is characterized by solitary suffering, wandering or uncertainty, and thus also temptation (a mirage or an oasis). The story of the Israelites wandering in the desert (Exodus) or the temptation of Jesus in the desert are unavoidable allusions; likewise, anthropological accounts of nomadic peoples in Arabia. For examples, the camel tests its strength in the desert, the lion becomes lord of its desert so that the symbol of desert presents a comic song of moral and sexual temptation in an oasis. This symbol relates closely to several others, including the south and wandering.

There are several related concepts about 'despising' with four different broad uses can be found.

The despising of the self. Christian self-despising arises from out of the impossibility of living up to the ideal of selfless acts, especially in the 'brilliant mirror' that is God's selflessness; similarly, to feel contented with some aspect of him or herself, the Christian must despise some other part. Such self-hatred creates an artistic 'need' of a lower kind: a narcotic to disguise
