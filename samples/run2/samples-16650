 Thus, even the belief in the bodily positing of things, as far as that thing is righteous and which is merely an expression of it. Sin is seen as human folly, an expression of our deeper psychological way of thinking. Anger is often misinterpreted as altruism, which its object is merely a reassessment of the origin of those occasional tranquil images of self.

Abyss has no end, limit or bottom'. The 'abyss of being' or 'abyss of things' to describe the lack of anything fixed and thing-like in the Dionysian conception of the real, which is thought of as underlying the realm of apparent things. 'Grund' in German also means 'ground' in the sense of 'reason' (as in 'what are your grounds for claiming that?'); therefore 'Abgrund' means a lack of justification, legitimacy, or sense. 'Abyss of reason'. 'Abyss' often links with the Sphinx, who killed herself by throwing herself from a high place after Oedipus successfully answered the riddle.  The idea are themselves abysses that they cause one to leave any solid intellectual or moral footing behind and thus represent danger. The idea of eternal recurrence is an 'abyss-deep thought', posing a threat of self-destruction or the ultimate dissolution of one's identity. the abyss is thus both an absolute and a defining characteristic of the abyss, because it allows one to look beyond oneself and allow the next stage of one’s gift of life to the ascent. the abyss is that which is the ‘last human’, not only among humans, but among animals and on many, many other worlds, but also among all animals. The lionable ape is also said to be the abyss. The abyss is thus a particular mode of life that is difficult to re-emerge within the ego – and thus also one that is differently understood as a characteristic of individual behaviours and so one’s contribution to the growth of cultures.

An action considered on its own is Handlung; being active is tätig, as in 'the active person'. Whether my will or my actions are free; can they ever be egoistic; and what does it mean to subject them to universal rules. Action is only possible under the illusion of freedom, or through a deliberate ignorance, because knowledge kills action. All our actions live on through an endless chain of consequences and are thus eternalised.  'Action' develops the notion of the will to power, the concept of action is included under it: for example, neither the fact nor expectation of happiness (at least in an ordinary sense of this term) is at the ground of action; instead, the ground is an expression of and a feeling of power.  One reason for this is that noble morality is concerned with the value of human beings, a 'triumphant yes-saying to oneself', and not with the features of actions (neither their conformity to laws nor their utility).

The life of action and the life of contemplation are distinct. Thus, 'action' is important, of the deed; knowledge has meaning only if fulfilled in effect. Indeed, the very notion of a 'doer' distinct from any deed is nonsense related to ideas of substance; a 'quantum of power' is not distinct from the will and effect. It also follows that there is both an error and something ignoble in 'disowning' one's actions by feeling the pang of a guilty conscience. Actions are necessary expressions of identity; to feel guilt (the criminal who has become 'pale') is to apply external criteria based upon consequences, and to falsely imagine that one's identity is not what it is; a further aspect to this concept is the cultivation of the capacity to be responsible. Action has no necessary relation to our knowledge or beliefs. Active people do not act out of self-knowledge but act so as thereby to form a self. Only the doer learns. Both active and contemplative forms of life are necessary, in alternation within a single life. The comprehensive 'new philosopher', then, would be neither merely the person of action nor the contemplative person. The contemplative life in its best sense should not be understood as an escape, but as a choice made from understanding as a mode of life. Opportunity is the right to experimentalize one’s life so as to better reflect on one’s conditions of growth and oneself. Likewise, these conditions have to do with the ability to take risks and have the strength to occur morally. There is a clear distinction between the ‘innocence’ of the contemplative and the human’, and this is different between the ‘creativity’ of things and of themselves that is their ‘innocence’ in the first place.

 Thus, the notion of compartmentalisation is also employed, namely what is considered as a compartmentalisation of causes and effects, which is a broader concept of value-judgment.

Third, all causes and effects belong to a single, cosmic organism. Thus, in contrast to the anaesthetised mind, which is a single organism attempting to influence all others, and which is meditative upon itself, and which is aware of itself; anaesthetisation is thus a part of our daily lives.

Abandoning is a ‘nonsense’ conclusion that what is rejected is their will to the truth. Notice that without a doubt the claims made about philosophy, metaphysics, chemistry, philosophy or religion are lies or 'errors' composed of ‘text’ (the word requires context). There is no questioning the nature of things or the nature of things' still. Nothing could be held absolute or even contradictory in both truth and falsehood. A false philosophy would have to include a decline in both science and culture (a 'Machiavellian' approach), as well as a return to the origin of knowledge (i.e. the problem of the German philosopher Essenes isappeared). This decline is traced back to the rise of the commercialization of culture and society, which in turn led to a decadent culture that was both industrial and state-directed.

The notion of chance is not, as one might have expected, primarily in the context of a discussion of physics or history. In these contexts, the much more common problem is the relationship between law, calculability, and necessity. The concept of chance reveals a vital ambiguity. On the one hand, history broadly and the life of an individual are subject to chance, meaning that there is no visible or comprehensible necessity and no repetition of events. Moreover, existence is characterized by chance in a grander sense: without overall or original purpose or meaning. Thus, even necessity has a chance-like character to it, since that necessity is not willed. Where its highest values are concerned, human cognition cannot accept chance; thus, the simplifying operation of cognition makes such chance appear as necessity and subjection to natural law, or as purpose or will. This simplification has moral consequences: the great idea of the innocence of chance is found at D13 in the context of a discussion of punishment. So, for example, simple mistakes are counted as crimes against God or justice, while the happy accident which is a great human being is accounted evil. Indeed, even the origin of those mental functions by which we think necessity (knowledge, reason, logic) lies in chance, that is in some fortunate event of prehistory in which a useful new characteristic or technique was stumbled upon. Likewise, the relationship between a genuine culture and the philosopher: without such a culture, the philosopher is a chance appearance like a ‘comet’. Moreover, without such a culture – that is to say, without the possibility of good will – the gods are certainly present in the first place, and this is no ‘consequences’ lack of culture.

The terms ‘death’ and ‘living organisms’ also indicate a transitional period from nuptial sounds to aggressive and sometimes frantic thinking. This is considered as a sign of degeneracy, as degeneration becomes a condition of life. This living organism is the subject, the problem and the ‘Result of Reason’. Questioning the whole system of life and one’s whole being is a dead end. Questioning the whole system of life and one’s whole body is a dead end. The dwarf is a crucial analogy for this. Human being one and the same as the function of culture, then, then, dwarf is by no means a sense-maker or creator, but instead a deceiving one who is aware of the truth and who even believes it. Thus, the human being is a ‘monster of culture’. Not all things are such that he or she is a ‘monster of culture’; in other words, what is and is not a ‘monster of culture’.

The function of anthropomorphism is in two parts. First, it is about the people, the group which walks beside the human and is characterized by constant growth and progress. Second, anthropomorphism is a new term to the concept of class. The first is the notion of the enemy, the caveman or contemplative. "Cunning or lack of conscience" signifies that it is a supremely creative and ecstatic domain of culture; second, the question of the purpose of conscience is a crucial one-dimensionally. The spectacle of the highest human beings struggling for eternity is both ‘semi-religious’ and ‘semi

 Thus, we also need to talk about the 'laws'. 

The laws generally have a broader meaning than just 'they'. Thus, 'the lawbreakers' are often called 'examples'. Moreover, 'theomosesse' is not theestory of sympathetically virtuous tragedy but at the origin of old ways and practices. The same is true of the allegory of the gods. Thus, for example, the idea of a 'sustaining' of the old Greek religion, which was the root of many a dark sorcery. Moreover, the story of Artolimus 'bringer of lightning' Rhodes, the first Greek to be proclaimed as the ‘hero of Greece’ is an essential figure. Likewise, it is precisely that kind of cleverness that is productive against pessimism, that is to say optimism concerning the spiritual world.

Along with Heraclitus, Epicurus is the ancient Greek philosopher. Epicurus took the atomism of Democritus and extended it into an ethical philosophy that had significant influence. The vital idea from Epicurus includes: first, liberation from irrational fears (e.g. of the gods) leading to a sense of tranquillity is the aim of the good life. In its extreme, this is a kind of self-hypnosis or deep sleep; similarly, liberation from desires extends beyond one’s capacity; third, liberation includes the ethical values of friendship and solitude; the last,  the gods are at least uninterested in human affairs, and indeed there is a hint in Epicurus that the gods are projections of human ethical values. In either case, it follows that the cosmos should be contemplated, but without fear, as chaotic and without purposes.

This concept of equal or equality is employed to analyses about strong or weak powers and the political implications of powers in equilibrium. The essential use of equality is in discussing the moral/political notions associated with democracy or class.

Eternal recurrence (or ‘return’) is among the most famous and widely discussed concepts. There are two broad (and not mutually exclusive) ways of interpreting eternal recurrence. Either it is a metaphysical/cosmological claim concerning reality; or it is a test of – or element within – the highest affirmation of life. On the first of these interpretations, the whole of the real exhibits only so many combinations, which are interlinked and follow in a definite order. Thus, in infinite time, the real must repeat itself in a vast ‘year’. On each cycle, the same entities and events occur.  

The second interpretation is more important, not least because, on its own, the first is irrelevant to human values or behaviours. To affirm eternal recurrence means to exist in such a way as to celebrate eternal recurrence as if it were a cosmological truth, to want its truth. Only that form of life that has (i) overcome nihilism, (ii) also overcome the temptation of pity for higher types that are incapable of further development, (iii) overcome nausea likewise at the thought of the periods of history dominated by ressentiment or degeneration, and (iv)  loves its fate  (the notion of amor fati), would be able to affirm the eternal recurrence of all things. Nihilism must be overcome because the affirmation of eternal recurrence is an assigning of value, but imminent one, rather than founded upon some origin or telos (end or purpose).  Pity must be overcome because to will eternal recurrence is also to will the destruction even of higher humans, and in general one must the rule which is the triumph of the ‘small’. Fate must be loved because the eternal recurrence demands a willing higher than just reconciliation with or acceptance of fate. That is an affirmation, even a longing for. Moreover, the commitment of eternal recurrence is the love not only of the whole course of things but specifically of my place within them. The love of fate must include gratitude towards the cruelty of accident and my own foolishness’s (i.e. the past must be redeemed), and desire for my own ‘is going under’ (my self-overcoming to further the development of the human after that).

It might seem odd to talk about the development of the human in this context. That, though, is precisely the point: eternal recurrence demands that we free our thought from any false sense of purposes (i.e. from teleology) or origins. The ‘year’ has no beginning or end (or every moment is both beginning and end). What
