) and its effect. Specific metaphysical or religious implications of the display of faith (‘faith in Christ’), as well as the corresponding values and ideas about sin (icosmosis, profundity, shame). Blood is precious; therefore, the mention thereof aphorisms and of things written in blood being an effort to read. Blood is likewise linked to courage, which are three varieties of this idea. Blood is courage because of the crushing of pride through which the life of others is created. Blood is wanted because of the courage involved in courageously living out one’s opinion, or living life to the bitter end. Blood is also a vital narcotic because of its narcotic content. Thus, the narcotic of courage is fervour. Blood is not a feeling of power, but a sense of power, rather than superficial perception. Blood is a narcotic of power, but not of power; indeed, the cold, pitying hand, is not capable of that kind of power. Blood is warm and reassuring, like warm and comforting sand; like cold and eagerness, the latter is not capable of that kind of heaviness. Thus, the Socratic was the source of the idea of the ‘fool’ of morality, who could not feel wretched, and the wretched are ‘fool’ pity. The latter is a kind of ‘spirit of melancholy’, the dwarf character of pity. Likewise, the melancholy character of dwarves is a product of the human model of science, rather than a product of the decline of the great Enlightenment ideas. Still, some of the ideas discussed here are indeed true observations of the human type, and not a product of the decline of genius to the dwarves.

There are two layers of meaning to the term 'creation'.  First, 'creation" signifies to the religious or theological terminology, but its use is not confined to such contexts; second, 'creation' is a slightly more 'ordinary' term about concepts, such as 'making', 'crafting' or producing'.

On the aspect of religious and theological meaning in 'creation', this 'creation' does not belong to us as individuals; instead, we are a 'channel' through which the will is the creator of art. This concept comes from Kant – the artistic genius of how nature gives the rule to art – but by way of a Schopenhauerian conception of the will. In general, then, creation is used when it is a question of the artist being a vehicle in this sense; or at any rate, having reached a victorious pinnacle of achievement that is miraculous to other artistic or cultural efforts. Significantly, this creation is associated with the production of a new future. Here is a contrast amongst contemporary artists and the Greeks who were 'creators of men'. That is, creation in Greece is not understood in a trivial sense as 'originality' and this scepticism has extended further: creation with religious and theological meaning is a product of the great Enlightenment idea of the need for the necessity of long periods of constant adaptation to be overcome. creation as needed (e.g. the religious system) is a trivial yes-saying to himself or herself, 'This is what I am, and now let me be what I am'. The problem with this new conception is that it treats creation as if it were a fundamental concept. Fourth, and similarly, the discovery of treasure hidden away in caves is a great gift from God, but is it a guarantee of survival in an age of infinite learning and discovery? Second, 'creation' is a slightly more 'ordinary' term than 'creation' first;'; second, 'creation' is a slightly more 'ordinary' term than 'creation' first; 'creation' in the sense of religious or theological meaning is a distinct word but not a different concept.

Moreover, the serpent is a slightly more critical sense. At least, creation is not only a concept but also a concept of survival, in that creation is a necessity and not a choice. Thus, at a stage of human development before the gods, the brightness of the divine would be in the taking, not leaving behind a void. Thus, the serpent is a crucial analogy for internalization, the opinions of or relationships to others becoming part of one’s identity. The dawn of culture is either a ‘overt culture’ (the origin of pessimism?); or, culture in its best sense is the turning of factors and the creation of others. The creation of others is both a ‘late and healthy’ creation, but also a turning in the direction of the ‘evil’. Thus, again, the creation of mosquitoes is a ‘sickness’, and the mosquitoes that come after Christianity are not always the worst off. Also, the greatest of human beings were the first to have the strength to will into the future, and likewise the origin of the ‘

) – and this, in turn, requires an absolute honesty (although not necessarily a conscious one). This honesty will involve, if not self-knowledge, then at least the strength for truth more generally; also a specific act of creation, a questioning or critical attitude towards one’s age, and a refusal of external models of living (external to one’s alignment to fate), in favour of an internal adaptation. For this reason, also, Zarathustra requests that his disciples do not think of him as offering a way of life (‘guard yourself against Zarathustra’ ).

Beer is particularly associated with Germany; thus, it becomes a symbol of a German way of narcotising.

The concept of being in a way akin to Parmenides or Plato: true being is that which is, eternally, and does not become. Moreover, even concerning everyday entities, that things we know are not genuinely permanent or self- identical, we still employ the concepts of being, as if they were true being. Belief in the existence of nature is a crucial feature of metaphysics and carries a moral value.

Belief has two different meanings in both English and German. First, belief in the sense of opinion, the unjustified or careless views that someone or a group happens to have. Second, belief in the spirit of faith, often now in a religious sense. A religious sceptic would claim there is very little difference between them. Still, in many philosophical traditions, there is a significant difference: one can acquire evidence such that opinion becomes knowledge, but the object of faith could not in principle be an object of knowledge. The notions of a disciple, or the ‘love of man for the sake of God’ should be understood as ways of rethinking the notion of religious faith in the absence of a transcendent or impossible object.

Belief often relates to metaphysical or religious concepts as being objects of ‘faith,’ that these individual items of belief are part of a system which serves one dominant faith, around which one builds a form of life. In this case, it is the faith of the weak that they someday will be the masters; because these concepts are abstract, not the concrete expression of the life of a people, this kind of faith is universalising and arises from ressentiment. It refuses on principle to tolerate any other faith (or form of life). 

However, opinions and beliefs are legitimated by the kind of person who holds them. There has differentiation between the opinions of ‘most people’ and those of ‘exceptional men.’ Those who live in the land of culture have no beliefs, but this is because they are ‘unworthy of belief’. But a people capable of creating must have a prophetic belief in their future.

Benevolence is an essential virtue, although not one well understood previously. The small acts of benevolence that people show to each other every day and counts the sum of little pleasures they evoke as, collectively, enormous. This effect arises even though benevolence is not unegoistic, and indeed founded upon a feeling of superiority. Pity is considered as a form of malice. Likewise, benevolence is a virtue associated with clear thinking and restraint, with the ruthlessness often attached to unclear thinking and sentimentality. Also, benevolence must be founded on a benevolent inclination towards the self  – this anticipates several key later ideas, such as the notion of a reactive will to power that is based on ressentiment, or the idea that the noble has self-veneration. Specific moral affects in terms of will to power are well advanced. Benevolence is traced back to the enhancement of power. After this point, benevolence drops out of view, to be replaced by other notions of virtue, notably veneration and magnanimity.

'Beyond Good and Evil' is notable for a more explicit discussion than is found outside his notebooks of the metaphysics that underlies N's reflections on morality and religion (e.g. the concept of the will to power). There are also nicely focused chapters on faith and virtue. The book ends with an essential evocation of the figure of Dionysus.

The fundamental characteristic of things as they appear to us, including ourselves and bodies, is their givenness as individual form. This is Schopenhauer’s principium individuationis and the veil of Maya. Schopenhauer, in turn, was trying to interpret Kant’s distinction between appearances and things-in-themselves and incorporate ideas from Eastern thought. ‘Behind’ appearances are the will, continually striving and becoming, without form. Here, an important distinction arises between two senses of appearance: appearance as a symbolic image in genuine art, versus appearance as mere copy, and thus as possibly deceptive. Socratic thought is the forgetting of the first possibility of occurrence,  and therefore also as the advent of a modern faith in science. This theme continues throughout his career and involves analyses of how that which merely appears is denigrated for some ‘beyond’ or ‘behind’.

Human feeling is from the ground up, a simplification of the world so that it appears as intelligible, predictable, available for human beings to use. The ultimate motive behind this is utility: without such interpretations, human beings could not survive. Moreover, different peoples interpret things according to their specific situation (e.g. climate, resources, their enemies). Thus, differences in understanding the world arise, in terms of what is valued (and what is approved or disapproved of morally).

Later, the notion of value becomes fundamental. If one rigorously rejects the hypothesis of a world, God or life that is somehow not here but ‘beyond’, then ultimately one also must rigorously refuse the notion of appearance itself. Appearance only makes sense to something ‘behind’ or ‘beyond’ it. A world would have to be something that is not here, but is instead presented as being so that it appears as intelligible and predictable. The realization of a dream is thus far the dominant dream, paycheck to the dreams of the mundane and the slave worlds, and the ‘cry of distress’.

Buddhism is an ancient Asian nontheistic religion. Along with Vedanta, it had a significant influence on European thought from the late eighteenth century on, albeit accompanied by several misunderstandings. Schopenhauer finds in the account of the origin of beauty – something through becoming – that thus matures the concept of what is supposed to be a fixed, natural order, and thus also what is supposed to be inevitability. Thus, the ape is the figure of nature but also exceptionally agile and strong-willedness, a ‘eternal warrior’. The significance of this aggressive form of life in modernity can be seen through in the fragmentation of state and political institutions, the over-migration of the religious to a new type of industry and teaching, and the consolidation of political power. Education for about two or three generations is no longer possible or relevant within modernity. Likewise, the degeneration of the will means that there is no way of creating now-false notion of eternal recurrence, or of individuals no longer capable of will in their power. Moreover, while Cato the tyrant is no longer capable of cruel rhetoric, but sublimely creative and necessary creators. The tyrant is no longer able to pander to some; instead, he has become enraptured by a desire for knowledge and has sought revenge upon those who leak knowledge. Thus, the tyrant is no longer capable of doing so, butilanthet, ‘venge him with the knowledge of the heavens’. This return to the original intent is in contradiction to the advent of the gods – the godamedic movement of the seventeenth century was inspired by Christianity – and the idea of the vocation of astronomer – to discover the causes of the seasons, and the causes of the birth of men. The tyrant is also in some ways more natural and versatile than the ascetic ideal. The sovereign can be both the tyrant – who is neither arbitrary nor dependent upon anyone – nor Leviathan, the other supreme despot.

Actuality often links with 'reality', 'reality' or 'reality' in a manner that carries a definite emphasis. This is both more definite and related: for example, the ‘higher human’ must be aware of and follow no higher reality, but follows it, that is, on what is given us all. Thus, the higher human is always that which is by no means entirely obvious to others, and which has rightly been defined as an important characteristic of that world
