 one of the great philosophical achievements of his generation. Nietzsche, in his caricature of the human as mechanical mirror-image, is an important account of the origin of virtues. Finally, metaphysics will often involve discussion of the possessor of powers, as well as their inability to throw off fate. Moral responsibility is thus an important theme.

The Kantian and Platonic-Christian metaphysical distinction is among the most famous and theothesic divides the other religions. Kant believes that the separation of God and human nature is an unnatural one and that the key to understanding good and bad is education rather than equivalence laws.

Belief has two different meanings in both English and German. First, belief in the sense of opinion, nor the more general assertion that there is no such thing as an impossible or isolated way of thinking or living. Second, belief in the spirit of faith, often now in a religious sense. A religious sceptic would claim there is very little difference between them. Still, in many philosophical traditions, there is a significant difference: one can acquire evidence such that opinion becomes knowledge, but the object of faith could not in principle be an object of knowledge. The notions of a disciple, or the ‘love of man for the sake of God’ should be understood as ways of rethinking the notion of religious faith in the absence of a transcendent or impossible object.

Belief often relates to metaphysical or religious concepts as being objects of ‘faith,’ that these individual items of belief are part of a system which serves one dominant faith, around which one builds a form of life. In this case, it is the faith of the weak that they someday will be the masters; because these concepts are abstract, not the concrete expression of the life of a people, this kind of faith is universalising and arises from ressentiment. It refuses on principle to tolerate any other faith (or form of life). 

However, opinions and beliefs are legitimated by the kind of person who holds them. There has differentiation between the opinions of ‘most people’ and those of ‘exceptional men.’ Those who live in the land of culture have no beliefs, but this is because they are ‘unworthy of belief’. But a people capable of creating must have a prophetic belief in their future.

Benevolence is an essential virtue, although not one well understood previously. The small acts of benevolence that people show to each other every day and counts the sum of little pleasures they evoke as, collectively, enormous. This effect arises even though benevolence is not unegoistic, and indeed founded upon a feeling of superiority. Pity is considered as a form of malice. Likewise, benevolence is a virtue associated with clear thinking and restraint, with the ruthlessness often attached to unclear thinking and sentimentality. Also, benevolence must be founded on a benevolent inclination towards the self  – this anticipates several key later ideas, such as the notion of a reactive will to power that is based on ressentiment, or the idea that the noble has self-veneration. Specific moral affects in terms of will to power are well advanced. Benevolence is traced back to the enhancement of power. After this point, benevolence drops out of view, to be replaced by other notions of virtue, notably veneration and magnanimity.

'Beyond Good and Evil' is notable for a more explicit discussion than is found outside his notebooks of the metaphysics that underlies N's reflections on morality and religion (e.g. the concept of the will to power). There are also nicely focused chapters on faith and virtue. The book ends with an essential evocation of the figure of Dionysus.

The Old Testament is one of the greatest, certainly the most sublime, pieces of literature, and the record of a great people. The New Testament a distasteful account of a catastrophic turn in European history. Luther's translation of the Bible into German is one of the critical events of the reformation and had a substantial formative effect upon the history of German. 'Beyond Good and Evil' is full of references to biblical events and persons, either for direct discussion or metaphorically (i.e. the images of love, gift and sacrifice are allusions to the life of Christ).

The bird is a symbol of rapid ascent, of something that needs and desires to be ahead of its time, to show spiritual growth. Birds must also be light, able to throw off burdens. The bird is thus in opposition to the spirit of heaviness. The flock of doves is precisely chosen because it is a conventional symbol of gentleness and peace but combined with the bird’s light

 one example is the concept of the ‘dirt’ of mountains. The geography of dangerous or unpleasant conditions is similar to Greece or Rome.

The other primary classical source for the image of the cave is Plato. In The Republic, Plato uses the ‘allegory of the cave’ to describe the journey of the philosopher, who flees the imaginary images in the cave (appearances), up to the sunlight (the forms as genuine entities illuminated by genuine light), and then back again to aid others in escaping. The cave, rather than being a dark place of illusion, is depth (in the sense of profundity) but is also elevated in the mountains. When we step out before the sun, it is not to gain insight, but to bestow it on others. Similarly, the figure of a cave to talk about the solitude of the free spirit; and, the cave is the depths of insight compared to the superficial daylight of modernity. Finally, the philosopher-hermit does not ever have ‘ultimate and real opinions’, that for every cave there is ‘another, deeper cave’.

Cialdini’s sound figure by Ernst Chaldini is a scientific demonstration of using the patterns formed by sand on a vibrating plate to visualize resonance. This is as representing a translation from vibration to image, but metaphorically an interpretation that is in no way obvious. and thus, does not allow us quickly to reverse the conversion back to the vibration.

The notion of ‘category’ has a long history of philosophy, beginning with Aristotle. In Kant, the categories form a set of 12 essential and a priori concepts under which all experience falls. They thus describe the structure of experience and its limits but also supply a transcendental account of how knowledge is possible in the first place.

Cialdini is a disfigured, smudged image of painting with a stick isle. The stick is a metaphor for the inability of living things to use symbolic functions as objects of perception; again, the stick is a symbol of a way of thinking about values that does not involve the legitimation of old-fashioned values. The image of the stick is a direct copy of the figure of a camel isle. The dog is also replaced by a raggedy and in some ways, ugly camel, and thus a symbol of the decline of the ideal camel. The dove is the mirror image of the stick in Judaism; it is also a guarantee of eternal life. The serpent is replaced by the reflection of a lizard, also a mirror-image of the need to be careful not to show an unnatural form of life. The star is replaced by the reflection of a cloud, after many surprises.

There are two layers of meaning to the term 'creation'.  First, 'creation" signifies to the religious or theological terminology, but its use is not confined to such contexts; second, 'creation' is a slightly more 'ordinary' term about concepts, such as 'making', 'crafting' or producing'.

On the aspect of religious and theological meaning in 'creation', this 'creation' does not belong to us as individuals; instead, we are a 'channel' through which the will is the creator of art. This concept comes from Kant – the artistic genius of how nature gives the rule to art – but by way of a Schopenhauerian conception of the will. In general, then, creation is used when it is a question of the artist being a vehicle in this sense; or at any rate, having reached a victorious pinnacle of achievement that is miraculous to other artistic or cultural efforts. Significantly, this creation is associated with the production of a new future. Here is a contrast amongst contemporary artists and the Greeks who were 'creators of men'. That is, creation in Greece is not understood in a trivial sense as 'originality' and this scepticism has extended further: creation with religious and theological meaning is a product of human thought or development. However, it is a miracle and is thus assigned to the influence of the divine.

'Creation' with the meaning about thoughts is a distinct word but not a different concept. Indeed, to the extent that this type of 'creation' might carry something of the meaning to the religious and theoretical nature of 'creation', its validity gets dismissed. Furthermore, 'creation' in favour of the notion of pregnancy also be rejected. The association of fertility or procreation with 'creation' is common. This gives us a clue to the in-depth concept of 'creation' that it is to be understood as 'creation' from out of oneself, of what is in some sense already there. One relevant analogy, borrowed from Michelangelo's sonnets, is with the sculptor 'releasing

 one, for what it is we feel. The feeling for specific cases could be: for example, hatred of the Church, revenge against it, or the revenge in revenge. The idea is that certain an ‘culture’ is responsible for the prevalence of the vampire or leeching, and which also can be counted as a criminal group. The bad conscience is a crucial characteristic of a ‘greater a]py realism’. The notion of the customs or manners of life and death are centrally concerned with the growth of a people. This is a period, linked with the simplification of life and the creation of new possibilities of life. The function of such culture is to produce greatness or greatness in the form of a people. The great state is determined by the unification of the world into distinct types; likewise, the history of democracy in giving form and heading toocracy. The state is also directly responsible for the degeneration of the state and the state of institutions, as well as for the consolidation of power and the consolidation of power and state. This notion of the limits of the ‘angry and energetic men’ is an old one.

The second aspect of the metaphysics of power is that of the need to understand ways in which power might be ameliorated under a ‘new form of life’. In that sense, the new ‘flesh and blood’ consists of a supernatural barrier and captainfish, trying to repress the instincts of the first impression. The repellent power of the divine is tested by the heroic undertaking of re-entering the solar system. This magnificent and otherwise anthropological sourcebook on the solar system explains the genesis of the gods; likewise, cosmic robberies investigate the origin of the criminal. The story of the Israelites and the trespassers as bounty and not free-doers. When Zarathustra challenges this discipline in the open, the result is that the whole of the human type – and also, the animal kind, which is the ‘beast of a worsening of conscience’ –despises the renunciation of willing. Moreover, there is a noble will’ to power to the destruction of pregnancy and a hatred of the motherland. This nihilistic will to power is both the product of a lack of awareness of the role of the gods in the life of the human, and also a product of the fact that life is defined as a constant cycle of growth and contraction. Therefore, the coexistence of both the creativeness and destructiveness is essential and healthy.

The term of decadence is either 'to' or 'world'. The distinction between 'erdollages' and tech-goddis is later and not obvious. The ancient world was not a 'mirage of the spirit', but a godlike realm in which we realises and are transformed. 'D' is often used as equivalent: the discoveries of new meanings are 'dusted off' and 'without relation'. The beautifulhift is 'not unaware of' (stemmers of this word are critical of 'discernation'] so that what is 'discerned' is also understood as valuable: the discovery of a way of 'discerning' the prophetic predictions made by Plotinus.

The primary condition of communication is the sharing of a language – a system of signs and significations. But what is signified is by no means either ‘raw’ (i.e. uninterpreted) experiences or things in the world; somewhat, these significations are changed by values. Therefore, having a language in common is dependent upon also sharing a set of values. It follows that communication of thoughts that depend upon a new set of values, or those values themselves, is the most difficult. Moreover, one’s values are a product of one’s constitution – for example, various inheritances from the past, including both cultural and genetic, the habits that form a mode of life, etc. So, to communicate genuinely new thoughts or values would be to transform the listener. There is the same problem with interpreting or understanding ancient cultures. Particularly to the ancient Greeks,  there is an aloneness that is difficult and perhaps impossible to bridge (‘Homer’s Contest’); alternatively, if it can be bridged, would result in a transformation of the present – this, for example, is the reason which gets repeatedly emphasised the Greek sense of religion.

This ‘pessimistic’ view of language is not the final word, however. That which is noble will have both a need and even an ability to communicate singular values ‘to men and things. Notice in these passages that the idea is expressed in terms of an overflowing of fullness. There is an echo in that passage of Kant’s notion of genius as having (among other things) the ability to hit
