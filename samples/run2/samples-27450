 <modern European' culture means that it is genuine, though simplified, and higher than that of Wagner'. Christianity is directly opposed to the values of the nobility of the nineteenth century and ruined the health of the nineteenth century. Christianity has a spiritual element in its use, though this is not understood in a trivial way. laissez-passionate" philosophers, such as Kant and Smolte, believed that group formation was the only way to guarantee the continuity of life. In Kant, obedience to circumstance is a necessity, not a pleasure. It is a necessity, more akin to a post-Enlightenment pessimism or withdrawal from the herd. The herd is something that a herd of sheep or cows is not, but a small group that is entirely irrelevant to life. Thus, the herd is not its own, it is not influenced or aligned by any one type of culture or life.

'Ant' defers to the symbol of work, especially industrial, as part of a homogeneous group. Also, it means small, incremental and in-themselves blind contributions and likewise a necessarily limited or fragmentary view of purposes or projects.

Anthropomorphism means to impose the form or qualities of the human onto something. The innumerable ways in which the histories of science, philosophy or religion have involved anthropomorphism. A key example is the concept of cause and effect in nature that this separation of cause and effect is an anthropomorphism, founded upon what is already a false characterisation of human action in terms of will. The whole of our knowledge of the world (including human beings) is anthropomorphic.

On the one hand, then, these anthropomorphisms are illegitimate (they are ‘lies’), despite their enormous utility for human beings. On the other hand, there stays a danger of the destruction of culture through the overemphasis on critique (historicism, specialisation, etc.). The generation of greatness, the flourishing and advancement of the human depend upon such ‘lies’ being productive in the realm of culture.

Anti-Semitism is a symptom of a weak and defensive culture, of ressentiment, of nationalism and of a form of asceticism that demands stimulation.

'Antichrist, The' should be understood more as ‘Anti-Christian’ and tightly focused on the psychological and physiological meanings of the advent, growth, and triumph of Christianity, in comparison, especially with Buddhism. Notable for a sustained, speculative, and positive psychological interpretation of  Jesus,  as akin to a  Buddhist.  It revolves around the contrast between this Jesus and the Christ figure disastrously generated by the Church Fathers, especially Paul.

Ape primate as akin to the animal aspect of humans’ pre-dates Darwin; with Darwin thought arises the notion of a common evolutionary ancestor. The ape, then, is either an origin or disfigured mirror-image, of which we are ashamed. The ape is an imitator, unaware even of being an imitator, and which brings disrepute to the imitated.

Aphorisms is a brief, self-contained and striking piece of writing, usually gathered in sequences. Aphoristic writing was common in ancient literature and was employed by many authors. First, a random series of very brief sayings or epigrams, and second a series of longer pieces, each like a short study. There are a few added variations. Likewise, and regardless of the presence of an overarching theme to the series, aphorisms can speak to each other, as if they were short segments of a continuous piece of writing. 

The different rhythms of these various ways of writing and the different interpretative demands make on readers. The function of such writing as fully formed, unified, and unchanging, and as thus akin to a type of lyric poetry: thus, the Dionysian sense of epic is a musical piecemeal; the Apollonian sense is a comprehensive and successful artform. The projection of these forms onto the human requires that they be feminine, straight-forward, and capable of affirmation and transformation. This must involve a conceptualization of the body as the androgyny of resonance and the absence of clarity of type. Here, the body – as ideal and symbol of gender, autonomy, etc. – is not the 'ground' of metaphysical thought, but the underlying image of such negative experiences in terms of physiologically impossible and therefore unlikely ways of living (‘transcendent ressentiment’).

Aesthetics is the philosophical treatment of art and related concepts.

<|endoftext|>

States of mind (or reports of states of consciousness) that include an immediate evaluation of the state of its objects, such as pain, pleasure, or the emotions. Moreover, these states assign objects as causes or locations (this is painful, that makes me angry, etc.). All these words could also be translated as either 'emotion' (though few would call pleasure or pain an emotion) or more commonly 'feeling'. The feeling can seem to be a value-neutral report of a factual state. However, the feeling as always an interpretation, bringing the concept of soul in line with that of effect – that is, a sense is an evaluation of some physiological state. Feelings such as pity or pleasure are equally appropriately called affects. 

Sadness either meaning a specific state of suffering, or more generally the idea of emotion, and an even better interpretation would be 'mood'. Sadness is one of the three means of successful persuasion along with logos "reasoning and truth", and ethos "way of life or character, and more specifically wisdom and virtue". Sadness means understanding how emotions lead to judgements and actions. Sadness shows a more permanent state, one that goes with and is a chief characteristic of a way of life.

Christianity rescues effects from the idea of disinterest, but only if their object is transferred to God; affects are not primarily individual, but socially conditioned. Affects arise in part also because of basic intellectual operations such as imagination. A parallel discussion denies that the affects as ordinarily understood are a fundamental feature of organisms; this amounts to a rejection of specific psychological ideas that understand human behaviour through, for example, pain or pleasure. Instead, there is a physiological basis of the affects in assimilation, transformation, excretion, etc. Such discussions culminate in the thought experiment concerning the will to power. Will to power is a primitive world of affects. In turn, the affects play a role in perception, avoiding or selecting – this infects even neutral scientific claims or if reason in some way masters the affects, then this has been achieved by a long process of cruel discipline.

Moral judgements are a sublimated (i.e. diverted to be in some way more acceptable) way of discharging affects. A revaluation of values would have to include a reassessment of affects. Specific affects, such as a lust, for example, need to be redeemed as valuable for the overall health and growth of the human organism. Others, including those that are a product of resentment and form a sublimation of and release of jealousy, should be revalued as modes of sickness. A necessary part of such a revaluation, though, is to influence the domain of affects – and not just to change our conscious or intellectual view of things. In other words, new values change the way we feel and are incorporated into the body. The Dionysian state as a total stimulation of the affective system, transforming itself through and into all affects.  The great human who can redeem reality does so by immersion, even identification, with it.

Affirmation is a yes-saying in two senses. First, a yes-saying to life, to fate, and to all the suffering or senseless destruction they in fact do and must- have. Second, a yes-saying to life or to all life is the moment of perfection and is thus a yes-saying to eternity. Thus, the life of the contemplative must be a yes-saying to life and all the life involved in eternal recurrence. In other words, a yes-saying to life is the moment of perfection and eternity associated, in a way, with the cat. This notion that there is a ‘xenophobic’ or ‘batty’ attitude to life that much more commonly refers to the ability to deal with non-threatening facts or emotions. Specific facts or emotions, such as a laugh or a ‘love of course’, are rejected as problematic. Conditions become described and studied, forming a set of three aspects: (i) the nature of the necessary, the innocent, and the ‘big’ thing, and (ii) the kind of person we are as a future. Thus, the necessary variety an individual in fact are able to have both a sense of right and a vocation’ – creating, as far as possible, a god or a people.

The other half of the concept of value is about the role of causes and effects in the real, to consider oneself to be the root cause of a ‘discipline’ among individuals. For this reason, we should think of the human as the 'ground' of the ‘governing ideal’, andederal ideal’, since it is

 < to be associated either with the decadence of the former, the distress of the latter or the overabundance of creative possibilities. There is a similar use of the concept of allegory. In all these cases, human practices or institutions that may have utility on their terms, but which gain much of their significance from their allegorical meaning. The sphere of knowledge is thus the broader or more narrow, historical sense or genuine religious responsibility. Notable for a sustained and continuous flow of data concerning the self and its future, this notion is at the heart of Kant's repellent philosopher. That is, the ascetic ideal must be somehow a way of a degenerated human group, who are in themselves not worthy of love or attention. Therefore, the proper application of the Greek concept of allegory and pure intellectual conscience is to the ascetic ideal be distinguished from the degenerated modern idea of the human and its mutually exclusive development in the sphere of culture and morality. This concept of allegory, together with a related one for the rehabilitation of the human from situations of suffering, is what gives the concept of faith a life of trust isover its covers.

However, the influence of decadence is not the problem or an exception; instead, the mention of the degeneration of the human causes the concept of allegory again.  One reason for the frequent development of the allegory of a child is the ‘obstini’ meaning of allegory itself. In fact, the same principle is at work in the nature of art to make art seem beautiful. However, things are changing and needs to be taught anew how torun and express itself. The song and dance are ‘formless and empty’ before the stars. The stars areemies and the things in common are truth and honesty. Ink and tears are therefore often used as an allusion. 

The allegory of the church and the healing effect of passion on love. Alternatively, the same idea is taught of the role of lyric poetry in Greek tragedy. The argument is that operas are ‘formless’ and  the poet has to inspire his or her audiences by illustrating and re-imagining.

Apollonian is named after the Greek God Apollo; this is one of three drives that it is a key to understanding cultural production and cultural change, from the ancient  Greek world on. The other two are Dionysian and Socratic. A  brief period in which the Apollonian and Dionysian work together produces ancient tragedy. The Apollonian is the origin of those cultural forms where beauty and clarity of form are emphasised (examples would be epic poetry, architecture, and sculpture), and the effects of calm or cheerfulness. Apollonian implicitly carries with it a metaphysical view concerning reality, that is, the belief that individual entities are ontologically original. Importantly, though, the Apollonian is also characterised by an awareness that these valued forms are an illusion to a Dionysian view of existence (a dream in which we are aware we are dreaming). Thus, the Apollonian should not be understood as a kind of self-deception or turning away from the real (that would be more akin to the Socratic). In his later work, the Apollonian is no longer thought of as a competing, brother drive to the Dionysian, but as a moment (of calm, stillness, beauty, image, etc.) within the latter. This is implicitly acknowledged that the ‘complete and authentic antagonism’ is between Homer and Plato: the former the deifier of life, the latter its ‘slanderer’.

The fundamental characteristic of things as they appear to us, including ourselves and bodies, is their givenness as individual form. This is Schopenhauer’s principium individuationis and the veil of Maya. Schopenhauer, in turn, was trying to interpret Kant’s distinction between appearances and things-in-themselves and incorporate ideas from Eastern thought. ‘Behind’ appearances are the will, continually striving and becoming, without form. Here, an important distinction arises between two senses of appearance: appearance as a symbolic image in genuine art, versus appearance as mere copy, and thus as possibly deceptive. Socratic thought is the forgetting of the first possibility of occurrence,  and therefore also as the advent of a modern faith in science. This theme continues throughout his career and involves analyses of how that which merely appears is denigrated for some ‘beyond’ or ‘behind’.

Human feeling is from the ground up, a simplification of the world so that it appears as intelligible, predictable, available for human beings to use. The ultimate motive behind this is utility: without such interpretations, human beings could not survive. Moreover, different peoples interpret things according to their specific situation (
