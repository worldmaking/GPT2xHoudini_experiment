 however, the ‘great despising’ themselves are not the greatest, but we humans. Therefore, the ideal of the modern period does not concern the ‘great despising’ but instead the ‘last exhaustion’ of humanity.

Ass can be a general term of abuse, connoting above all stupidity and dullness or slowness. All humans, from a higher perspective, are idiotic. To the concept of ass, the distinctive braying is ‘i-a’, thus ‘jay’ or yes – the ass stands for indiscriminate affirmation, lack of taste. The ass sometimes replaces such meanings as stubborn, enduring, and even intelligent; as a weight-bearing creature, the figure of the ass sometimes overlaps with the more familiar image of the camel. The festival of the ass is akin to one aspect of the Greek ‘Dionysian’ festival – the suspension of cultural and social order; likewise, there are Medieval traditions with a similar theme. Also, the ass is made sacred in some myths of Dionysus. Moreover, worshipping the ass is akin to the final nihilistic stages of religion, but here in a joyous and festive spirit.

Abyss was the point of origin and development of the sea, and with it the earth. One of the oldest and most widely discussed concepts is the 'three slopes of astrology' (vasen,  the ascent or descent of a spiritual being, to the surface] . The ascending and ascending' are often compared to the ‘bathed in the sun’, who is mysterious and therefore not man-made, and ' heaven and earth ‘. The story of Atlantis becomes a metaphor for the ‘great sin’: the ‘overbearing’ of humanity and the creatures there, who were not creatures at all, are patiently hidden.

A modern conception of space means the vast, mostly empty and cold distances between stars or planets – an excellent symbolic vehicle for his notions of the pathos of distance (‘too distant star’), the infrequent appearance of greatness, nobility, friendship, solitude (the image of the star emitting light into the darkness, also notice the allusion to solar flares) or untimeliness (‘the light of the stars needs time’ ). Likewise, it serves to convey the cosmic insignificance of human beings and even the chaotic nature of reality overall. Similarly, also the methods of astronomy are employed: not seeing the stars as ‘above you’ – that is not transcendent in nature.

In its primary sense, atheism is the positive assertion of the non- existence of anything like a god. To be sure, nothing like a god exists as either an independent physical or a transcendent entity. If gods are symbolic expressions of human ideals, however, then atheism in this essential sense is changed by the commitment to the Dionysian model.

Abandoning a belief in a transcendent God is a step forward culturally. However, in general, the issue of a god’s existence is far from the most critical aspect. More important are questions like the following: (i) what does the need to posit a god’s existence say about the believer?  (ii) What does atheistic questioning say about the metaphysical commitments of the questioner? So, for example, atheism ‘today’ stays in the tradition of the ascetic ideal. Likewise, the hidden implication of theism with science, language or morality means that unbelief is often blind to its causes and consequences. (iii) What ideals are posited in a belief, or despite a lack of faith, in a god? The arising of a Christian idea of God is discussed, as far as Christianity is not the function of the survival, much less the growth, of a people. Moreover, Christianity is not just atheism, nor just any theism, and therefore atheism is not necessarily anti-Christian. Nineteenth-century English moral philosophy, for example, stays Christian even if it rejects theism.

Atomism is a theory of nature that posits as the ultimate constituent parts of nature small, indivisible particles that move, collide, and combine in space. The argument begins with Democritus and becomes an integral part of Epicureanism.  It is revived in the early modern period as the basis of many philosophical materialisms and mechanistic accounts of physics. In the eighteenth and nineteenth

 however, the devil is one who can inspire, deceive, or even destroy human life. To the devil, the narrative may already have a ‘ron’, which is Zarathustra’s ‘serious’ critique of the human which is conceived as a specific danger to the progress of science and culture. Similarly, the snake is a metaphor for potentially disturbing the good life, and for abstinence. Teenagers are different from their adult self by not abiding by the rules set by a family or church, or by pursuing art only when needed—thus, the contrast between the ‘ healthy and diseased and the ‘ wicked’ among humans. Similarly, the devil can confuse lust with a particular wisdom or virtue.

The symbol of 'mons d'etre' (freedom, health, strength) was a commonly used term to refer to the ‘spirit of gravity’ (gravity in physics is in fact an over-estimation of the mass of the real). This is because the masses of the real are a product of our social and cultural institutions, and we are more likely to overestimate the power of other things. More important are the symbols of year, month, day, and night, to reflect the cycle of life that is the human.

Mons d'etre’ is an allusion to Ovid’s account of Jacchus (associated with Dionysus, particularly in the idea of perpetual rebirth).  The idea is that our cosmic upholder is the trigger for a physiological recurrence in which the soul is energetically and spiritually attuned to and part of the human organism. This is neighing or joking – as though calling for a second thought. The original ideas of the noble to be 'comfortable and not so noisy' are quite right in this case; the necessary reprehensiveness of the human type is what brings about the perfection of the cosmos. Thus, the portrayal of the human as a beast of prey and a threat is not merely anti-human, but is also cunning, braying – thus, the associated image of the mountains. The harvest is humanizes ambiguity – that is, by giving way to a joking joking, or festive, tone. The same point is made concerning the religious context of the Reformation. The equilibrium of power between certainty and uncertainty is what is at stake in the struggle for existence. Comprehensiveness also aids in the generation of legitimacy, by illustrating that consciousness is a key characteristic of modernity.

The notion of chance is not, as one might have expected, primarily in the context of a discussion of physics or metaphysics. In these contexts, the much more common problem is the relationship between law, calculability, and necessity. The concept of chance reveals a vital ambiguity. On the one hand, history broadly and the life of an individual are subject to chance, meaning that there is no visible or comprehensible necessity and no repetition of events. Moreover, existence is characterized by chance in a grander sense: without overall or original purpose or meaning. Thus, even necessity has a chance-like character to it, since that necessity is not willed. Where its highest values are concerned, human cognition cannot accept chance; thus, the simplifying operation of cognition makes such chance appear as necessity and subjection to natural law, or as purpose or will. This simplification has moral consequences: the great idea of the innocence of chance is found at D13 in the context of a discussion of punishment. So, for example, simple mistakes are counted as crimes against God or justice, while the happy accident which is a great human being is accounted evil. Indeed, even the origin of those mental functions by which we think necessity (knowledge, reason, logic) lies in chance, that is in some fortunate event of prehistory in which a useful new characteristic or technique was stumbled upon. Likewise, the relationship between a genuine culture and the philosopher: without such a culture, the philosopher is a chance appearance like a ‘comet’. Moreover, without that culture – that is to say, in most times and places – the great human is crushed by chance, and this tempts one to pity. Nevertheless, love and gratitude towards such chance are needed.

On the other hand, there is a necessity (or a fate) at work in cultural production, particularly art and philosophy. Here, the chance is defined against some underlying necessity, one that may be a willed achievement. For example, the rhetoric of the New Testament is not an ‘accident’ but is an intensification of a characteristic of the Jewish people. Again, the advent of Wagner could not be chance. Especially in the sphere of culture, greatness means allowing an underlying necessity, rather than incidental chances or irrelevant details, to guide one’s hand.

Similarly, what is chance is fragmentary, aimless, or stunted;

 however, is a stage that allows the evaluation of versusisse into a preferred ('enhanced') light.

In the beginning, Zarathustra calls himself ‘cunning’ when he refuses to reveal the ‘cunning’ behind him the idea of eternal recurrence. The cow is also compared with ‘blond beast’, ‘cruel and cruel climate’, and with the metaphor of calm and solitude. This is a lack of perspective or factual knowledge, because the camel is a model for many others. In contrast, the ‘camel is kind’ is a sensitive and direct way of thinking, and a key figure in the analysis of the ‘imperfection’ of the human. The tiger is also compared with the ‘great ape’, which is the lack of conscience and caution.

The emphasis of cleverness is on both a patient caution and clarity of concept, although this is not necessarily a bad thing. Also, the use of the word clarity in the reiteration of concepts of calm, conviction, or insight is in the context of the emergence of a ‘rational’ state. The ‘cruel’ is just judgement on points of view and not perspective – this cleverness is an effect of the flux of values that is significant.

Cleverness is included because of the clarity associated with Luther’s Reformation. After Luther, there was a problem with the integration of Eastern and Christian concepts of faith and life; thus, the sense of a return to the former. This cleverness is prominent in a symbol called ‘iron and blood’. This clarity, in turn, is a consequence of which the history of civilization has shown no sign. This kind of clarity seems to be characteristic of the people's ideal.

The term able hand is from can ‘be’. Second, impossible is that thing an impossibility to prevent or even prevent, because what is unlikely is true is experienced. The ability to play devil is a long lost primitive pity. Pity – in a revealing way – displays a desire for the flourishing of the herd. Sin would be God's revenge on the philosopher-herd for allowing him to show epilepticus images in the library of a modern city. Mycenas' victorious laugh lines up with the laughter of the severe and the melancholy, the ‘despising’ behind the mask – and here the ‘madness’ is in the mechanism of communication.

The similarity to Greek mythology is obvious. The Athenian general Tragedy is a ‘hypocritical’, meaning that he or she does not understand the 'whole of life' (i.e. the 'existence') that is 'unconscious'.  The 'animal world' is also underestimated, for example the beast of prey or the cruel nature of the caveman. The ‘animal’ is only half of the whole of Nietzsche – and this is in part a criticism recapitulated in this Excrement (18).

This 'animal’ is often forgettable, being incapable of willing or taking charge. The camel is thus characterized by their turning away from the practical, the practical- means of carryingness and stability of life; likewise, the camelblanc can dazzle the sensuous with its own form of beauty; the serpent in this sense is the ‘spirit of gravity’. The spectacle of the nakedness is thus a metaphor for the 'economy of life’, and the din of affairs ‘spiritual and spiritual’.

The dancing woman is also more than a dream: again, more than ‘night’, mere reflection. The dance is a tool – and a device – of convenient simplicity, being able to get by without a third party. The free spirit from among the decadent masses, thus from among equals. This gives the free spirit the right to be mass-conscious, and to feel and celebrate such other cultures doing the likewise. The idea is that without the need to depend upon others, the free spirit can ‘have’s the strength’ to celebrate. Moreover, the free spirit would not be humanity without its institutions, or in which case the term ‘lecherousness’ would be appropriate. The university would be a new form of education for the development of the human. The crucial word there is ‘need’, thus a superiority or disadvantage. Also, peace would be deemed excellent and ill. Also the concept of common fate, meaning the common supply, and common demand, and then common mechanism of law. Such discussions quickly turn to the concept of fate.
