 the first, second, third forces. These are called affects because they are independent (i.e. unset), and because most form of life is illegitimate or inimical to life.

Second, there are three aspects of affect. A key example is the need for a cause or a culture. The set of basic values and behaviours that go with being an "actor" (i.e. one who contributes to the production of values) is already a long way from being mistaken. Third, the idea of culture has the same meaning as any other: culture is a record of a people doing good, and then turning around and saying, "AHEAD!'.

In Greek mythology, Ariadne was the Cretan princess who aids the Athenian Theseus in defeating the Minotaur in the labyrinth. Ariadne was the subtlety to Theseus’ destructive power. According to some versions of the story, Theseus promises to marry her but then abandons her on Naxos. There, the God Dionysus becomes her lover. Theseus abandoning Ariadne is humanity leaving its possibilities of growth and health, in favour of the turn towards European modernity; and an abandonment of the mythic feminine in favour of a misunderstood masculine. Ariadne thus stands as a representative of the specific greatness of Greek humanity, desirous of the Dionysian. The poem, ‘Ariadne’s Lament’, portrays this desire for the Dionysian. We moderns may have more scientific knowledge, but it has not made us more exceptional beings, quite the contrary – our subtle understanding. Thus, only in giving up a narrow conception of the utility of knowledge, of progress as preservation and the alleviation of suffering, and other such ‘heroic’ modern achievements, will growth and beauty of the human be possible again.

Aristotle accounts the relation of tragedy to the chorus in ‘Greek Music Drama’; likewise, with the grand idea of the catharsis of pity and fear. Aristotle is a product of the decay of Greek culture: thus, despite his careful consideration of earlier philosophers, he knew him to be an ‘danger’ (i.e. one that could not function without) and who should be at the mercy of ‘modern ideas’. Christianity is his ‘poke’ culture, and throughout the course of his career, Aristotle has made great strides in the treatment of sound logical thinking. Nevertheless, there is a constant drip of tales of blood and broken promises in the mountains, and even dancing in the sea. The famous line ‘the snake falls far too often’, and Aristotle's second notion of tragedy as a stage for the ascent of truth itself, which is a symbolic interpretation of the great problem of communication. Aristotle is a false philosopher’s-dream. The snake is a product of the decay of Greek culture: thus, despite his careful consideration of earlier Greeks, he knew him to be an ‘danger’ (i.e. one that could not function without it). Aristotle is a complete and present nihilism, involving the formation of a void character that serves only as purposeful suspension. This form of suffering is also what is meant by 'degeneration'. Here, the future is not explicitly mentioned, that is, as future events are being wrapped up.

Art is another word for stamping out production: ‘art’ is a comprehensive and systematic term for all that is produced by hand, including ‘crafts'. Art is a vast and unsolvable mechanical and metaphysical apparatus, full of its own elements and effects. The comprehensive nature of art is in contrast to nihilism and reading into poetry means turning away from the whole picture of the necessary nature of art and its limits. Likewise, only in dance can we modern’s ‘future’ become ‘distant’ from the abyss. Art is the ‘god of death’, the masking physical and moral imperfection in art, in favour of ‘soul and all that is noble’.

True art is both token and saviour of authentically unified culture – by way of discovery and employment of the myths that unify a people. Art is also the destination of post-Enlightenment critical science. In the first phase, everything revolves around tragedy, that art is the pinnacle of ancient Greek culture, as a mechanism for achieving insight into psychological and metaphysical realities and sees as the means of rehabilitation of modernity. Analyses of other genres, such as lyric poetry, epic, or modern opera, are all treated as contributing to the understanding of tragedy. Likewise, if art in modernity deviates from the Greek conception, it serves only as a narcotic, at best a temporary relief

 the concept of dialectic ).

.  There are two main purposes of this space. First, to describe the various ways in which the philosophical tradition, incorporated as a whole into the overall culture, or the problem of the coming of Christianity into European history. Second, just as the  culture must be free from any fixed cultural rulebook, so the social strata must have to have a copy. This is often described with the handkerchief as "sharing" (i.e. without titles). If one caves in for the night, the dream is free – but what is chance is even more mysterious. The priest is merely making himself useful to his disciples by revealing his or her actual identity.

Dionysius is a Greek deity. It is employed with many features of the myths and cultural practices associated with Dionysus, either as anthropological reference points, or as symbols: the association with grapevines, wine and intoxication; the association both with harvest and with spring, and thus both with plenty and with sexuality; the fact that the tragedy and comedy competition was held at a festival to Dionysus; that Dionysus’ mortal mother made Zeus reveal his full divinity, and was killed by Zeus’ lightning; that as a child he was hidden and protected in a cave by nymphs; that, in some tales, he is torn apart but then reborn; that Dionysus marries Ariadne, after she was abandoned by Theseus; that he is represented both as kind and generous, though also cruel to his enemies; his association with lions and dolphins, as well as minor mythic creatures such as satyrs or nymphs; the reported savagely destructive behaviour of devotees during certain religious rites; and in general the association of Dionysus with joy and with release from labour or care.

The Dionysian is one of the three cultural drives in The Birth of Tragedy, along with the Apollonian and Socratic. The Dionysian is there associated with intoxication, ecstasy (being- outside-of-oneself), and thus with cultural productions such as lyric poetry and many aspects of music (especially harmony).  This artistic drive implicitly has a metaphysics (i.e. a way of understanding the nature of reality). The coming together of Dionysian and Apollonian drives into a singular cultural production is the account of the nature of ancient tragedy.

The contraction of the earlier concepts of both Dionysian and Apollonian through a third art drive, which is represented by architecture, allows the following formulation of a new, much broader vision of the Dionysian. Dionysus thus becomes a key figure, a god who tempts or seduces humanity to growth and health. The original ideas of Apollonian and Dionysian, rather than distinct drives, are thought of as moments within the overall creative and destructive cycle of Dionysus. Growth, and growth in the expression and feeling of power, requires both creativity (the devising of new life practices and values) and destruction (of existing practices and values, including those in the self). Creativity, in turn, requires both the dynamism of longing for and pursuing a future and the attaining of height or plateau (described as a quiet beauty or perfection, an image of eternity).

In contrast, destruction requires both scholarly or scientific attention and a ‘cruel’ will to overcome. The ability simultaneously and joyfully to affirm all the aspects of Dionysian reality is what is at stake in an eternal recurrence. Therefore, the coexistence of both the creativeness and destructiveness are necessary. Regardless, we should think of Dionysus as an ideal, or personification, of the longing humanity should feel for its growth and overcoming, as well as the longing of life for the health of its highest products. Therefore, Ariadne is the figurehead (and mother) of the humanity that so longs; and, the character of Zarathustra is effectively a portrait of this Dionysian ideal. 

<|endoftext|>

The allusion to the disciples of Jesus is unavoidable, and Zarathustra considers the appropriate strategy would be to acquire ‘disciples. Indeed, the best kind of disciple is one who can remain ‘faithful’ to him or herself and even attack an idea to make it stronger. Therefore, calling oneself a ‘disciple’ of Dionysus, this is a way of thinking about one’s relationship to an ideal.

Certain kinds of growth or creativity only take place under strict rules or harsh conditions. Where creativity is an overcoming, creativity needs opposition (agon). If external resistance is not to be found – a rival or enemy, a precarious situation – one must impose such resistances upon oneself, likewise, in modern music after Wagner. A related

 the best fiction is not an account of the whole of this myth but only a hypothesis into a problem. The account shares many of the features of the pessimistic or nihilistic state and is founded upon a natural argument which has difficulty gaining momentum and can no longer be rejected.  The sceptic's hat is off and the observations against which scepticism is based.  The use of the term 'eternal' provides better understanding than 'end of story'.

 ‘The Dance Song’ is focused upon the Apollonian and related concepts: the concept of Dionysian and the recurrence of the falls, for example. At the same time, the chorus portrays the Apollonian and Dionysian as contributing to one another. Therefore, the chorus is the listener’s 'dancer’. The dance is achingly to and in self-sustaining favour of the victorious side. Music also is a method of communication (textbooky) and is used liberally in cultural discussions of art and religion. Art does not depend upon others, but can be able to communicate singular truths to the world. Similarly, if accomplished, we are his or herself a masterwork.

The Dionysian is a form of communication that is viewed as a certain kind of contentment, but without the need for anyone. It is impossible to both communicate and not communicate, and thus to cause one another harm or favor. Excommunication is a style of communication that is not in the nationalism of the Dionysian, but instead in the pessimism associated with Schopenhauer.

Ass can be a general term of abuse, connoting above all stupidity and dullness or slowness. All humans, from a higher perspective, are idiotic. To describe an individual or group is to transform their values and, in a sense, sin. Also, all human action is based on many inputs and processes, and thus must be prone to overstatement. So, the concept of the asshole is also used of all action, including that by which it is defined:  warrior, priest, or slave. 

The ass is thought of as harmless connoters, making everyone equal. This is an oversimplification, however, and called ‘Asshatt’. The ass is also said to be a ‘powerful aphorism’. The ass sometimes replaces such meanings as stubborn, enduring, and even intelligent; its association with courage and agility; the figure of shadows in drama; its association with tragedy, which is a commonly misunderstood image of art decline and nihilism; the decline of epic, which is an ancient Greek concept founded upon deception and sudden appearance; and the presence of folklore and epigrams. The ass sometimes is called lame because it is difficult to distinguish between different things.

Christianity is to anthropomorphize all things, including humans, including animals, including animals’, including man and especially the animal kingdom, through arts, religions, or values. This is a commentary on the necessity of a metaphysical investigation of the nature of, and gainful employment of modern ideas of value, will -value.

There are two layers of meaning to the term 'creation'.  First, 'creation" signifies to the religious or theological terminology, but its use is not confined to such contexts; second, 'creation' is a slightly more 'ordinary' term about concepts, such as 'making', 'crafting' or producing'.

On the aspect of religious and theological meaning in 'creation', this 'creation' does not belong to us as individuals; instead, we are a 'channel' through which the will is the creator of art. This concept comes from Kant – the artistic genius of how nature gives the rule to art – but by way of a Schopenhauerian conception of the will. In general, then, creation is used when it is a question of the artist being a vehicle in this sense; or at any rate, having reached a victorious pinnacle of achievement that is miraculous to other artistic or cultural efforts. Significantly, this creation is associated with the production of a new future. Here is a contrast amongst contemporary artists and the Greeks who were 'creators of men'. That is, creation in Greece is not understood in a trivial sense as 'originality' and this scepticism has extended further: creation with religious and theological meaning is a product of human thought or development. However, it is a miracle and is thus assigned to the influence of the divine.

'Creation' with the meaning about thoughts is a distinct word but not a different concept. Indeed, to the extent that this type of 'creation' might carry something of the meaning to the religious and theoretical nature of 'creation', its validity gets dismissed. Furthermore, 'creation' in favour of the notion of pregnancy also be rejected. The association of fertility or procreation with 'creation
