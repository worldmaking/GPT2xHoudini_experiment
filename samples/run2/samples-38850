The first step in understanding the nature of tragedy is the development of new types of audiences. The actor may look to transform their world in the image of a god (Apollonian and Dionysian). These interpretations may involve a trivial revaluation of the original idea of Apollonian as cold rationality and Dionysian as the opportunity of his or herself to be reborn in the present. The expression of an idea of oneself as capable of turning around and passingivity is a perennial theme.

‘Asia’ or the ‘East’ usually delivers to the following ideas that Russia as a significant rival to European power, or as a critical origin for nihilism and anarchism;  culture, social systems or philosophical systems in India or China, founded on Hinduism or Buddhism; relatedly, China about its capacity for an industrious class without resentment; the area to the east of Greek civilisation, particularly as the ‘prehistory’ of the Dionysian.

Ass can be a general term of abuse, connoting above all stupidity and dullness or slowness. All humans, from a higher perspective, are idiotic. To the concept of ass, the distinctive braying is ‘i-a’, thus ‘jay’ or yes – the ass stands for indiscriminate affirmation, lack of taste. The ass sometimes replaces such meanings as stubborn, enduring, and even intelligent; as a weight-bearing creature, the figure of the ass sometimes overlaps with the more familiar image of the camel. The festival of the ass is akin to one aspect of the Greek ‘Dionysian’ festival – the suspension of cultural and social order; likewise, there are Medieval traditions with a similar theme. Also, the ass is made sacred in some myths of Dionysus. Moreover, worshipping the ass is akin to the final nihilistic stages of religion, but here in a joyous and festive spirit.

A modern conception of space means the vast, mostly empty and cold distances between stars or planets – an excellent symbolic vehicle for his notions of the pathos of distance (‘too distant star’), the infrequent appearance of greatness, nobility, friendship, solitude (the image of the star emitting light into the darkness, also notice the allusion to solar flares) or untimeliness (‘the light of the stars needs time’ ). Likewise, it serves to convey the cosmic insignificance of human beings and even the chaotic nature of reality overall. Similarly, also the methods of astronomy are employed: not seeing the stars as ‘above you’ – that is not transcendent in nature.

In its primary sense, atheism is the positive assertion of the non- existence of anything like a god. To be sure, nothing like a god exists as either an independent physical or a transcendent entity. If gods are symbolic expressions of human ideals, however, then atheism in this essential sense is changed by the commitment to the Dionysian model.

Abandoning a belief in a transcendent God is a step forward culturally. However, in general, the issue of a god’s existence is far from the most critical aspect. More important are questions like the following: (i) what does the need to posit a god’s existence say about the believer?  (ii) What does atheistic questioning say about the metaphysical commitments of the questioner? So, for example, atheism ‘today’ stays in the tradition of the ascetic ideal. Likewise, the hidden implication of theism with science, language or morality means that unbelief is often blind to its causes and consequences. (iii) What ideals are posited in a belief, or despite a lack of faith, in a god? The arising of a Christian idea of God is discussed, as far as Christianity is not the function of the survival, much less the growth, of a people. Moreover, Christianity is not just atheism, nor just any theism, and therefore atheism is not necessarily anti-Christian. Nineteenth-century English moral philosophy, for example, stays Christian even if it rejects theism.

Atomism is a theory of nature that posits as the ultimate constituent parts of nature small, indivisible particles that move, collide, and combine in space. The argument begins with Democritus and becomes an integral part of Epicureanism.  It is revived in the early modern period as the basis of many philosophical materialisms and mechanistic accounts of physics. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, atomism received a boost because of the success of the science of chemistry, and likewise its role in models of thermodynamics. As a comprehensive account of nature, atomism always had specific weaknesses, such as its difficulty

The whole of Greek mythology and much of European modernity begins with Apollonian Thees in the city (and other cities), from there it leads to the myth of the lion Hera’s courage and the birth of Tragedy.

The bird is a symbol of rapid ascent, of something that needs and desires to be ahead of its time, to show spiritual growth. Birds must also be light, able to throw off burdens. The bird is thus in opposition to the spirit of heaviness. The dove is the figure of a strong and kind-hearted individual, who similarly has a prophetic dream. This is a sonorous and festive music, as if they were two acoustic instruments. The dove is the figure of a strong and kind-minded individual, who has a vision and is eventually smothered by gloom. The dove is also the symbol of a human who believes itself to be the co-creater of the world and thus has the strength to overcome. Thus, the dove is the figure of a human who has found peace and happiness in the co-existence of several drives but is also tempted by hatred of one’s limitations and self.

The dove is also the bird of some ancient  allegory. The allegory begins when Dionysus marries Ariadne, after she was abandoned by Theseus. The marriage of the gods is a theme of great deal to befall one species while the other appears to be a tension within the total health of the human. This is both a recognition of the true nature of existence and also as a chance to explore the relationship between life and fiction. The dove is also lionised because of its role in several ancient myths. The lion figures prominently hint the first sign of the health and growth of humanity that we are about to see. The eagle is the symbol of an individual who has ‘power’ over oneself and thus has a chance to prove their mettle. The eagle is a common eagle, with the same origin and meaning as the bird of prey. The bird of prey is mysterious and therefore not obvious from the figure of the eagle. The serpent is the other hand, the other bird of prey because of its association with eternal recurrence, and also because of the association of Dionysus with Chaos. This means that, in all its ugly and primitive, chaotic nature, beauty and cleanliness are needed.

The eagle is the most ancient of the three, and the one whose time has flowed more by way of contemplation and thus by becoming more aware of the causes and effects of our actions and our lives. Thus, the eagle is the most ancient of the gods, and the one who can redeem creation from beneath. The eagle is a crucial analogy for internalization, the opinions of or relationships to others becoming part of one’s identity. The eagle is a crucial analogy for the higher men and women of the society when they are struggling to survive, and also for those who are called "worthy’. The eagle is a crucial analogy for the types of individuals who are incapable of willing greatness. The eagle is clever, but it is incapable of love and not willing altruism. The eagle is kind, but that love not willing, will be disfigured and abandoned. The eagle is kind is the basis of many moral types. The eagle is kind is generous, but it is kind not cruel. Such kindness is also part of the notion of pity. The eagle is a good-bye to problems of class, nation or gender, and from such situation is found the ‘perfect’ death, or at least is warm and reassuring to those who love and are loved. The eagle is warm and reassuring, and also the soul’s good and bad, and thus is also virtue and the need for self-control. Thus, the eagle is a need-and-control figure, both in art and life ‘beyond’ bad. The bird is quiet, and the sky is the right distance from the human, making space for dreams and other deviant aspects of our lives. The eagle is the bird of prey, and the meaning of this is this: If we think the eagle to be a threat, then improving ourselves is our path of growth, and not the enemy of.

In Greek mythology, Ariadne was the Cretan princess who aids the Athenian Theseus in defeating the Minotaur in the labyrinth. Ariadne was the subtlety to Theseus’ destructive power. According to some versions of the story, Theseus promises to marry her but then abandons her on Naxos. There, the God Dionysus becomes her lover. Theseus abandoning Ariadne is humanity leaving its possibilities of growth and health, in favour of the turn towards European modernity; and an abandonment of the mythic feminine in favour of a misunderstood masculine. Ariadne thus stands as a representative

The most sustained and comprehensive account of consciousness is the account of the origin or process of consciousness; likewise, the whole of the waking day is a breeding ground for the most ingenious means of life. The waking person is, therefore, always a breeding ground for lies – of the kind that is often discussed in philosophical history class. The specialization of knowledge means that it is not the domain of beliefs, but the 'purpose' of which is to investigate the 'nature' of the human. The different levels of knowledge allow people to pursue the same ‘teaches’ – the aim is not to become ‘knowledge’, but to make ‘knowledge’. The ‘knowledge of the cow’ uses the old concept of distinction (Bismarck), subtleties, and differences, and the great human who is only partly aware of his or her ground (‘On Truth and Lies’), and then brings it to the attention of the priest about the sin it has disgraced. This is the ‘reval of virtue’: those women who remain are ‘condemned’ and those who remain are praised for being honest and weak.

The death of God is one of the greatest, most sublime, most sublime, most transcendent, and the defining symbol of his or her condition of growth. It is also the theme of her loneliness and inability to lead him after he goesad her into becoming disciples of the god.

"God is such a bad communicator" - the joke at the expense of religious controversy, which was often over points of interpretation, and the recently developed science of biblical hermeneutics, the purpose of which was to apply the rigorous methods of philology and history to sacred texts. Such lousy communication leads to scepticism and atheism; it, thus, drives to the death of God.

Comprehensiveness is a concept without a single term to name it. Comprehensiveness describes an individual who encompasses and can employ a variety of different states, drives or types of knowledge. Thus, comprehensiveness stands especially in contrast to the specialization typical of modern intellectual life. It is related to the idea of the multiple (the human soul is various), and to the wanderer who has no fixed cultural home and sees and takes part in much. Comprehensiveness also describes the various abilities, all separately developed in human prehistory, that needed to come together to make the thinker. Analogously, it either links to the emergence of the comprehensive ‘individual’ who can live ‘beyond’ the morality of some old, decaying culture. The philosopher must be able to see with many eyes, to view things from many perspectives; to develop this ability of  ‘brief habits’—similarly, the ability to function concerning both science and other aspects of culture.

Comprehensiveness is thus a feature of a future philosophical nobility, to be distinguished from the nobility of a narrowly perfected culture, as well as from the anti-culture of the historical sense. This historical sense is a kind of comprehensiveness but without discrimination, without any setting of limits. Such an ideal requires dangerous experiences to enable judgements about the value of modes of life. Greatness is judged in fact by the ability for comprehensiveness. Comprehensiveness thus describes a height that is not that of abstraction and represents an overall responsibility for the development of the human, and which can use a wide variety of cultural forms and institutions as tools. Such responsibility will be able to take on all the hopes and disasters of the past and present, and still rise joyfully to greet the dawn. Thus, comprehensiveness is also related to the ideas of the gift and pregnancy.

When talking about concepts, philosophical concepts or the fundamental concepts of a religion or culture, it refers to, for example, substance, cause, virtue, sin. Any discussion of concepts, therefore, will also be a discussion of philosophy, metaphysics, religion etc. Concepts form a system – that is, individual concepts cannot be isolated but must be understood as a whole way of thinking (and living and evaluating), and likewise studied in their historically developing and repeating interconnection. Philosophical concepts are later and dependent upon the underlying values that produce language. Thus, for example, philosophical concepts are governed or generated by the grammar. Even the belief in the validity of concept-formation has philosophical implications. Concepts may also be able to influence those values. When, under the pressure of discoveries or critique, a concept gives way the result is memorably described as a ‘concept- quake’.

About the concept of conditions, it is a  broad contention that nothing is isolated, pure, or unconditional, that is everything is only properly understood in its concrete context and by following the various ‘conditions’ under which it
